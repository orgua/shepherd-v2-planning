Flocklab
=========

The Package
-----------

- 30 complete observer-nodes (current deployment)
- one laptop as server
- and / or 25 boards as extension or replacement


Current State
-------------

- project is open-source, with no plans to commercialize
- testbed is very mature and stable (nodes only fail rarely)
- most maintenance is for new users that break the interface or services (in a novel way)
- software is consisting of

    - observer: python 3.4 scripts, c programs, pru firmware (rocketlogger and one pru completely programmed in assembly)
    - server: python scripts, php web-frontend, mysql-database, xml-parsing
    - flocklab-tools: python-lib for uploading tests, analysing and visualizing data

- some things to be aware of

    - system is mature, but software is aging slowly for ~ 4 - 6 years
    - beaglebone uses debian 9, kernel 4.14, python 3.4 -> should be separated in a network
    - there are no unittests!
    - some things are destined to fail, ie. for experiments there is a 1 minute setup and finalizing phase, after that the next experiment can run. but with power traces enabled the data collection from the beaglebones creates high cpu-usage and may crash the followup experiment

- relocation overhead was seen as minimal - mostly changing the URLs
- Stats (2022-6)

    - 35 active users, last 12 month
    - 5 minutes mean test duration
    - with covid the usage decreased but it is rising again
    - currently 15 % utilization
    - most used modules (from high to low): serial, gpio tracing, actuation, power profiling,
    - most used targets: dpp2-lora, nrf,

- wireless energy traces were planned for special nodes, also interference

Why should we inherit Flocklab
------------------------------

- do we learn something from running it?
- do we plan to use it more frequently?
- there are two other potential maintainers


Flocklab Details
----------------

API: https://gitlab.ethz.ch/tec/public/flocklab/wiki/-/wikis/Man/Services

XML: https://gitlab.ethz.ch/tec/public/flocklab/wiki/-/wikis/Man/XmlConfig#debug-configuration

- it is possible to configure a test online, download the xml and use variations of it for later experiments


- experiments

    - 1 minute setup and finalizing time -> copy data, start services
	- copying (scp) continues and may collide with followup experiment

- a lot of code is in scripts - 2 cronjobs, 1 SQL-DB (setup-script for structure in git), PHP Frontend

- rarely to no defects for sd-cards or emmc-storage
- GPIO sampling

    - written as ASM-File / firmware, 20 Cycles, 10 Mhz, but only shortly with full bandwidth
    - there are two buffers that are read from userspace -> ~ 16 kB
	- 10 MHz only for short period of time -> after that only ~ 500 kHz

- no unittests, only manual testing

- cleaner - for stuck and zombie threads / experiments
- visualizierung -> bokeh, web

- rocketlogger is pru-code + analog frontend (8 channel, 24 bit ADC)

- sync with gps is sub 100 ns accurate
- sync with ptp is only < 10 us -> most definitly caused by nw-switch

- adc for current measurement can capture single digit nano-amps - but noise is reducing resolution to ~ 100 nA


Learnings and Homework for Shepherd
-----------------------------------

- flocklab backbone / infrastructure is not helpful for shepherd, but the mature APIs collect years of user-experience
- interference and wireless energy traces would be awesome to have -> simulated channel environment would be best -> without that the tests are not reliably reproducable

- targets

    - tmote target is good for publicity (msp430 + cc2420) but currently only rarely used
    - uwb - is coming, low power and standardized,
    - Lora important -> but power draw is ~ 150 mA, +22db, sx1262+ -> but there are ICs with only 14 dBm

- 16 stations with years of solar traces, before and after solar cell
- lower sampling rates are useful for users (less data, faster processing & download)
- uart should be available as plain text with start- and end-timestamp (postprocessing on server)
- frontend

    - updates and maintenance messages per email
    - high level overview for data useful -> plots with bokeh
    - flockid variable of the taget-images will be patched with node-id
    - sweep for automatized tests very useful -> also add human readable fields (title & description) to encode documentation
    - netcat link to beaglebones -> serial-interface to targets
    - User can choose which observer ID (fixed hardware ID) is part of the experiment -> gets (re)numbered as node ID (also used as flockid for target-fw)
    - some or most logs can be compiled to one per experiment (currently one per observer)

- backend

    - testbed should collect hardware-id / cpu serial of targets and map out what kind of target is where
    - better error-management -> log everything
    - beaglebone-status is not necessarily part of the user-data
    - gpio actuation (!!!!) with level, offset, period, count
    - unused modules (power tracing, ...) can really be turned of -> saves overhead
    - use checksums for firmware and traces -> reusable with that ID

- managed userbase with quotas seems like a valid approach

- beaglebones ethernet interface can lock up -> bbbrtc unlock, long reset -> josh.com
- add plausability tests, ie. BBone pings server and restarts if not accessible
- writing in bulk to RAM seems important - as the PRU locks up the ARM-Core
- PRU: min & max cycles per loop for both PRUs
- simulation is interesting -> only solar ? iv-curve -> basic idea: take an embedded system, remove solar cell and connect it to our testbed



- sub ms sync - xx us - for debug traces
