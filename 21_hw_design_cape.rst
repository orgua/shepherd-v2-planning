Design - Hardware - Shepherd-Cape
=================================

schematics Open
    - STOP, until here
    - (processed 11_concept.file)
    - BB Pinheader Cape-Design Stays -> possible alternaltive Producer is Samtech
    - add target port (comparator-include?) System will be a nRF52840
    - connect BB-Pins, 500 Ohm to input pins that could be driven from both sides
    - add footprint for quality-control-panel
    - check output limits of opax388
    - compare lowNoise LDO to LM27762

Design-Changes, mostly advantages
    - shunt for current-sensing included in Voltage-Buffer-Loop, so output stays the same -> voltages sensing ADC only needed for calibration
    - 2 separate fast ADCs are perfect for parallel and faster data acquisition
    - Analog-Switch to target had 4 Ohms Resistance?
    - old biDir Level-Translaters Type TXB needed 3mA drive strength, and even leaked 1-2uA when off
        - TI: TXS and TXB need side A to have a higher Vin as side B because of a protection diode
        - TI: LSF needs side B to be higher Voltage
    - ultra low noise LDO for all analog ICs
    - EMI-Cage for recorder and emulator
    - rugged external input power on shepherd module
    - watchdog-timer to trigger boot and reset
    - extra low leakage recording
    - high speed low power gpio to target
    - support for two targets
    -

schematics Postponed
    - internal calibration? with 2 switches and 1 calibration-linear-power-supply
    - OP-Amp, bias Subtractor: LMP7701MF, not needed now
    - sync to pps -> external pcb

        - DAC
            - previous: **DAC8562SDGSR**, mouser 595-DAC8562SDGSR
                - 50 MHz SPI, 7-10 us Settling, 1-4 mV Zero-Scale-Error, 40 mA Short-Circuit-Current,
            - constraints: >= 16 bit, SMD, 2 CH, not maxim, v-range ~2.5...5.5 V, short settling time
                - this could also be low-res and slow for only bq-output-sim, but it would benefit to also tap in cap-voltage directly

            - replacement: AD5663ARMZ-REEL7, mouser 584-AD5663ARMZ-R7
                - 50 MHz SPI, 4 us Settling, Zero-Scale-Error<1mV, 30mA Shor-Circuit-Current, needs voltage reference, WATCH OUT - there are versions with midpoint-start
        - OpAmp for V-BUF 2CH?
            - previous: **OPA2388IDGKT**, digikey 296-50277-2-ND
                - 30-60 mA perm, 5 V/us, 7 nV / sqrtHz, 0.25 uV Offset,

            - replacement: AD8606ARMZ-REEL, mouser 584-AD8606ARMZ-R
                - 2CH, 80 mA, 5 V/us, 8 nV/sqrtHz, 20 uV Input Offset,
        - shunt-Resistor
            - nRF52 takes 9 mA @ 4dBm, 16 mA @ 8 dBm for ~ 200 us, rest is below 2 mA,
            - previous: 2 Ohm 1% -> 16 mA => 32 mV, would mean 1% Voltage drop at 3V3, less would be better
            - current sensors are no alternative, too expensive, not enough resolution
            - replacement: 1 Ohm 0.1%-> 1:1 mA:mA, 0603 or 1206
                - **RT1206BRD071RL**, mouser 603-RT1206BRD071RL

    - Cage
    - Part Properties:
        - price (for ten), manufacturer, manufacturer id, shop 1, shop 1 ID, ...
        - special properties: max voltage, power, current, size / package, color, forward Voltage
    - extra information (i2c-adress, spi-speed, ) directly in schematic
    - power-recording-stage
        - DAC DAC80501ZDGSR
        - OPAmp OPA388ID, pin-compatible with LTC2050HV
        - nMOS SI2374DS, test with BSH103
        - ShuntOPAmp Ina190A1IDCKR
    - power in via vdd_5v (P5/6) -> Test shows: BB does not power up via sys_5v
    - reboot / boot via Pin-Toggle (Shutdown via command), we should trigger both (RESn->PD,PWR->PD), Test shows: Reset works while PWR is in PD
    - add 256 GB USB-Stick
    - switch to smaller IC-Packages and 0402
    - order / add GPS
    - is the gps capable of alarm (wake up sys)
    - our 5V analogue should be stabilized more! Add A5V with 2 Stage Bead, or real coil
    - add footprint for layer-windows
    - add footprint for shepherd-logo
    - give INA190 a negative supply (>1mV would be enough) on GND-pin, ref stays on common gnd, extra decouple
    - Debug-Pins with Ground
    - extend harvest-Port, add option to measure VSense, and output VCap (V_A of Emulator)
    - it would be wise to detach a5v even further from 5V, with a low-drop diode
    - EMI-guard SPI, currentlimit at pinheader, terminate at ICs, 33 Ohms close to cpu recommended (avoid reflections)
    - add alarm-feature, something SPI-programmable, that can act like a watchdog, with at least max 1-4h windows
    - check against shepherd v1.5
    - don't shut down individual Emu / Rec - Parts (delete or just disable all at once) -> done by Pwr-control
    - Harvester needs second channel ADC with very low input current, 1MOhm is too low
    - manual button with LED -> connector S4B-ZR-SM4A-TF, P1 3V3, P2 LED ODrain, P3 SenseButton with PU, P4-6 GND
    - add ultra low noise LDO to A5V, and possibly a boost-converter upfront
    - find better level translator, less current (best if near 0)

PCB Open
    - 4 Layer! Sig, GND, 5V, 3V3
    - decide Manufacturer, EC, Aisler, Betalayout
    - add design rules
