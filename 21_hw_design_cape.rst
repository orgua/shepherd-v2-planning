Design - Hardware - Shepherd-Cape
=================================

schematics Open
---------------
- prepare calibration
- ordered not enough 15uH Coils, need 30 more
- check remainder of BOM for emu-only assembly
- shepV1 had a user-space led, which is still there, same pin, but pru-controlled, was it the same in v1?
- explain schematics,

Part Changes (after Mouser-Order - NOW already ordered)
-------------------------------------------------------
- DAC       100nF -> 1uF
- Boost     10uF -> 10uF (inv)
- Inv       +47uF
- Rec       2x 10k 0603 -> 0402
- All       34x 1uF/16V/0603 -> 1uF/25V/0402
- final Shield, cover & frame
- all       4x 15uH/4mm -> 15uH/3mm
- parts of nRF-Target

schematics Postponed
--------------------
- internal calibration? with 2 switches and 1 calibration-linear-power-supply
- OP-Amp, bias Subtractor: LMP7701MF, not needed now
- sync to pps -> external pcb
- usb-socket is impossible to hand-solder right now
- (maybe) add PU to watchdog outputs
- separate PCBs for PPS-Source, Recorder, Emulator

Changes for v2.0r2
------------------
- only 5 diodes of type PMEG in order?
- change 100 uF to 47u? one less component
- Testpad should be square for GND, half-circle for Signal or similar
- r3 (dac, emu)
- proper naming for TP if there is space

- TPs should have bigger hole, so probes stick
- oscillating opAmp should be outside of cage
- allow install of a big cap on A5V or 5V, 5v5 1F is cheap
- add longer pinheader for p8/p9 23-46

Changes for v2.1r0
------------------
- if there is enough space -> switch out 47uH Coil of LC-LP to 150uF (larger)
- additional PCB for POE
    - poe is noisy (up to 25 mVpp for TL-POE10R, 300 mVpp for NoNameThing)
    - switching regulator for 12/9 to 6V
    - linear regulator with proper noise resistance for 6 to 5V
    - OR just 2-Stage LC-LowPass (15uA / 770mA from previous Order), additional 100 uF
- fix layerwindows

Done Changes for v2.1r0
-------------------------
- level translators - implement single voltage supply
- smooth 6v-boost -> larger capacitors 58uF to 158uF, ferrite, lower boost-voltage 5.38 V instead of 6.766
    - typical on A5V are 38mA for Quiet/On, 150mA max, mp3221 gives formular for upper thresholds of Vpp
    - old config: 164 uVpp (38mA) to 645 uVpp (150mA)
    - new config: 27 uVpp (38mA) to 104 uVpp (150mA) -> effect of ferrite not included
    - LDO is rated for 60 dB dampening, but measurements show a factor of ~ 500x of ripple rejection
- 6V Regulator overdrive is edgy, sw-pin is good for +8V, currently there are ~ 7.14 V
- Target-IO-PUs - get powered by unmonitored voltage buffer
- add 3v3 converter (linear), because BB provides very noisy power (both 5V & 3V)
- make sure shepherd works (theoretically) with BB Black (not only Green) -> Boot-CFG is identical
- recheck which IC gets which voltage (5V Sys is exceptional noisy)
- allow to run completely from external power -> move sys-5v ferrite
- main power switch not needed
- mark ext input
- sensitive lines should get more distance from gnd-polygon
- consider ultra low noise ldo for -6 and 10V
    - No suitable 5 to 10V voltage doubler found (fast switching, low noise)
    - there are quiet inverters (LM27761) though
    - see "noise_performance.rst" for more info
- adjusted Pads of some footprints - reduce width a bit when solder resist was too narrow on ICs

additional Parts v2.1r0
-------------------------
- lvl trans: 2x 240k, 2x 1M, 1x NLAS4684
- emu vSwing: 10R 0.1%, 1.1k 1%
- emu vDrop: NLAS4684, 100nF?
- A3v3: lp2989-3.3, 10nF X7R,
- VSenseStabilize: 1k
- 6V Stabilize: 576k, 100uF, Ferrite
- InAmp Stabilize: 100nF, 100k
- DNP: Ferrite 5V_SYS (for pwr-rerouting)
- removed: 1x NLAS, 2x Ferrite
- 16VStability: 4x 33uH, 4x 10uF

**Power-Budget v2.1r0**
-------------------------
- see separate spreadsheet (PowerConsumption.ods)
- BB takes <= 2W
- Shepherd MAX ~ 1 W (4mW @ 3V, 743mW @ 5V, 36mW @ 6V, 74mW @ 16V) (with 2x 50mA Target)
- Shepherd ON ~ 340 mW (4mW @ 3V, 190mW @ 5V, 36mW @ 6V, 74mW @ 16V)
- ON Quiet Current matches with reality (66mA measured, 68mA calculated)

General rule for assembly-drawings
----------------------------------
- origin orientation
    - keepout
    - assembly notes (mech15)
- designator
    - keepout
    - top designator (mech 2?)
- Copper / Silk
    - L1 Pads / Via
    - Keepout
    - Top Overlay
-> print in Color

Done Changes for v2.0r2
-------------------------
- silkscreen - 10k array are 1k
- 3d-Step: shield transparent for better view below
- silk. "P3" designator is below component
- pads of 0402 bigger, 1.2x1.2 as min area for pads? paste 0.8x0.8? got some tombstones on current revision
   - half a pad distance to neighbour (keepout)
- improve connection betwenn pads (esp. 0402)
- feducial seems massive, shrink it?
- SPI-CS with at least 33R to lower chance of interference
- R for BatteryGood is wrong (handled by PRU), should it also be routed to userspace?
- TC7WH-Footprint is to large
- HC2G-comment (Name) is wrong / twisted
- DAC pads could be longer, reach more under the IC
- MP32 has no dot on package, just [ABC], lower left is pin1
- NSR (or all diodes) could get a line on the 3d-file (current dot is confusing, because the actual package has line and dot)
- the orange led is red! ... bad UI for general blinking
- describe gain of OP-Amp in schematic
- 100R, accuracy is missing in description / constraints
- Silk for L9/L10
- essential silk-numbers on headers can be bigger/bold, a bit more distance from header
- rename rec to harvest, port on pcb more obvious
- harvest dAC ch-b - drain power source OK?
- improve marking on Voltages, maybe with an arrow
- reverse diode of mosfet is too weak - already destroyed the reverse polarity protection
- some popular Flag-Markers on backside for pinheader
- Pin1 dot should be a shallow/sharp triangle, pointing in the right direction (less confusing in dense layouts)
- transistor-footprint is not conform to datasheet, it is slighly bigger and just misses the pads?!?
- u13 thermal to wide, reduce a bit to avoid shorts (u15 has same possible weakness)
- rework als Pin-Descriptions (already mentioned)
- round and divided (big) paste pads
- add general power-led when shepherd is on? maybe on 6V line
- switch to thinner stencil, bigger pads (paste is good for it)
- header-row on target has paste, it should not
- Font/Writing in copper is unreadable on target (slighly below spec)
- add layer for manual / pick'and'place descriptions (m15, m?)
- qr code is not readable, blurred, reduce size of "pixel"
- warning for harvest V_sense -> Voltage floats if not connected and will most likely show V-Max in this state
- ADC nRST should not get A5V, only 3.3, also there is no need for a resistor-switch
- Connector for external switch was copied from old schematic, but this one had inversed pin-numbering on connector, different from datasheet
- Testpoint on RVS-Pin of
- protect GND better around Pinheaders
- U25A, Inputs are switched
- diode between both 5V-lines should be two diodes that feed the watchdog
- 3V3 should also be switched - maybe even the 5V0 in, so the PU that hinder bootup are meaningless
- vias came back only weak tainted (make it less severe if that happens), mainly for target pcb
- more distance to gnd-plane (soldering is hard, even with thermals
- TEST Watchdog, make compatible with BB
- TEST GPIO to and from target
- same orientation for transistors
- switch p8-27 and 29 (batOK / GPIO4) for cleaner readout
- switch p8-43/44 with p8-39/40 for proper boot
- TEST boot with all pins except 3v3 & 5V
- but make sure that shepherd-EN (p8-13) stays low during boot
- switching main power to both targets shows, that the routes seem to have different current-readings for the same load! odd
- 1k for LEDs
- check surroundings of mosfets, size has changed
- mosfet of watchdog-wake could be tied to 3V3 with additional 1k resistor or diode (so that button stays usable)
    - 100k PD for wd-pin (or keep 10k)
    - 3V3 goes low on powerdown, so watchdog can enable (pull low wake) BB again,
    - polling has no effect during normal operation
    - TEST if 1k is enough to pull line low to enable -> it is
- add open source hardware logo?

        - constraints: >= 16 bit, SMD, 2 CH, not maxim, v-range ~2.5...5.5 V, short settling time
            - this could also be low-res and slow for only bq-output-sim, but it would benefit to also tap in cap-voltage directly

            - 2CH, 80 mA, 5 V/us, 8 nV/sqrtHz, 20 uV Input Offset,
    - shunt-Resistor
        - nRF52 takes 9 mA @ 4dBm, 16 mA @ 8 dBm for ~ 200 us, rest is below 2 mA,
        - previous: 2 Ohm 1% -> 16 mA => 32 mV, would mean 1% Voltage drop at 3V3, less would be better
        - current sensors are no alternative, too expensive, not enough resolution
        - replacement: 1 Ohm 0.1%-> 1:1 mA:mA, 0603 or 1206

    - nMOS SI2374DS, test with BSH103
    - ShuntOPAmp Ina190A1IDCKR
- power in via vdd_5v (P5/6) -> Test shows: BB does not power up via sys_5v
- reboot / boot via Pin-Toggle (Shutdown via command), we should trigger both (RESn->PD,PWR->PD), Test shows: Reset works while PWR is in PD
- add 256 GB USB-Stick
- switch to smaller IC-Packages and 0402
- order / add GPS
- is the gps capable of alarm (wake up sys)
- our 5V analogue should be stabilized more! Add A5V with 2 Stage Bead, or real coil
- add footprint for layer-windows
- add footprint for shepherd-logo
- give INA190 a negative supply (>1mV would be enough) on GND-pin, ref stays on common gnd, extra decouple
- Debug-Pins with Ground
- extend harvest-Port, add option to measure VSense, and output VCap (V_A of Emulator)
- it would be wise to detach a5v even further from 5V, with a low-drop diode
- EMI-guard SPI, currentlimit at pinheader, terminate at ICs, 33 Ohms close to cpu recommended (avoid reflections)
- add alarm-feature, something SPI-programmable, that can act like a watchdog, with at least max 1-4h windows
- check against shepherd v1.5
- don't shut down individual Emu / Rec - Parts (delete or just disable all at once) -> done by Pwr-control
- Harvester needs second channel ADC with very low input current, 1MOhm is too low
- manual button with LED -> connector S4B-ZR-SM4A-TF, P1 3V3, P2 LED ODrain, P3 SenseButton with PU, P4-6 GND
- add ultra low noise LDO to A5V, and possibly a boost-converter upfront
- find better level translator, less current (best if near 0)
- reprocessed 11_concept.file
- switched Ina190 for AD8421
- added boost/Inverter for proper voltage rail
- add target port (comparator-include?) System will be a nRF52840 and most likely a MSP430
    - try to make it compatible with breadboard / dev-Kit
    - is spy-by-wire physically compatible with swd -> it is, TClock is uni-dir, TDIO is bi-dir
- replace 100nF/16, 1uF/16, 10uF/16
- BOM, more precise alternative - BB uses 32.768 kHz osci MC-306 (20 ppm, 8x3.8mm) or similar, package says 327A5M
    - alternative: 5 ppm, 12.5pF, 50 kOhm, https://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/Citizen-FineDevice/CM200C32768HZFT?qs=rkhjVJ6%2F3ELrGt3qchcVtQ%3D%3D
    - BB also uses 24.576 MHz
- check output limits of opax388 and DAC
- compare lowNoise LDO to LM27762
- 750 kOhm 1%,  667-ERJ-2RKF7503X, 5 + 32
- connect BB-Pins, 500 Ohm to input pins that could be driven from both sides
- complete ERC
- 1uF/16V is still 0603, change to 0402, there are 34x (incl. Recorder)
- redistribute capacitors
- replace coil with smaller one, check recommended direction
- add 1kR & 100R high precision for current measurement, EMU
- order digikey (extBut, samtec), mouser, csv
- add footprint for quality-control-panel
- BB Pinheader Cape-Design Stays -> possible alternaltive Producer is Samtech, design is now divided
- add production-constraints
- update BOM
- v2r1 ordered

PCB Closed
-----------
- 4 Layer! Planes for Sig, GND, A5V, (3V3)
- decide Manufacturer, EC, Aisler, Betalayout
- add design rules
- add layer stackup
- add default vias
- divide in groups / rooms
- optimize surroundings of ICs
- change vias of pson50, dfn-10 (by lt3487 spec)
- move lvlchangers to the left
- change pads of pinheaders in inner layers
- thermal pad of switch unused? yes, no word of use in datasheet
- increase restring / holesize, sheph seems to have 0.15mm holes?, target 0.075 ring
