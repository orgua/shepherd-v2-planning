Unsolved, not mentioned Details in Requirements
===============================================

Hardware
    - how to control distant long-Range-Nodes or mobile ones
        - idea 1: tcp based (mobile network) for control-side-channel
        - idea 2: scheduled via pre-configuration (node needs access to time-base)
        - input marco: shouldn't be high priority, but considered in hw-design
    - variable TX-Power of Target for multi-hop â†’ is it enough to change firmware or do we need (programmable) attenuation?
        - input kai: firmware should suffice
    - GP-Capelet-Port: are there any future-extensions (sensors, actors) that would require a general purpose capelet-Port (SDR-Extension is not feasible for shepherd nodes)
        - there are still unused GPIO available, even a uart, but no SPI or I2C
    - preferred casing choices:
        - Var1: off-the-shelf case with custom front-plates
        - Var2: laser-cut-acrylic box?

Software
    - Target configuration
        - do all targets get the same firmware, is it precompiled?
        - is it already individualized, is it done by hardware / MAC, or do we have to change IDs in binary?
    - how to switch between targets? (if there are two on the Cape)
        - Var 1: in local python script, for every node individually
        - Var 2: preselected on server


Current Tasks
=============

Testbed
-------

- wait for ZIH-Answer regarding rules, (hw) requirements
- when ZIH has vLAN ready: test if infrastructure of university is sufficient, mostly regarding ptp
- for node-distribution
    - talk with the leaders of groups that occupy offices
    - examine offices with IT-Admin
- measure link quality around cfaed-floors
- for global server access -> security concept needed

Hardware - mostly shepherd Cape
-------------------------------

- target-relays/switches : multi-pin, low leakage, high data-rate
    - current uni-direction (gpio) -> SN74LV4T125PWR -> are diodes needed?
    - current bi-direction (uart, swd) -> TXB0304RUTR
    - optimal specs: v_in & v_ref_a & v_ref_b (3 separate levels), IO-Ports
- power-switches: low leakage
- level-changer: high speed, low-power, possible combination with switch / programmable
- find large pin-count gpio-switch (target-selector)
- is there a better power-path?
  - find reason for substractor (EMU-I)
  - why is uni-dir level switcher not on vdd-target -> it could get into undefined state
- draw digital version of float chart for power-stage
   - where is V_CREF coming from, or is it flowing backwards from VOC_SAMP?
   - is there a possibility that (CV)-LDO drives against MPPT-Converter in a unwanted state?
- test accessing GPIO Periphery via PRU, register address
- look at https://github.com/cdsteinkuehler/beaglebone-universal-io
- some routine is driving gpio on boot -> input kai: not uboot

Software - RealTime-Code
------------------------

- does beaglebone AI with TI AM5729 offer more pins for PRU? https://www.ti.com/product/AM5729
- PRU replacement? FPGA, CPLD would be overkill, but what is with a teensy 4? lots of iO, SPI with DMA, FPU, 600 MHz
    - https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html
- test shepherd and make PR for shepherd1
- find a better name for vCap, like vEH, vPwr
- try to access host gpio peripheral via pru -> would make pin-doubling redundant
- try to benchmark the loop (debug-pin-high when processing)

Software - Python
-----------------

- figure out a system to bulk-initialize scenario, measurement, but also individualize certain nodes if needed
   - build "default" one and deep-copy and individualize -> this could be part of a test-bed-module-handler
      - test-bed instantiates beaglebone-nodes [1..30] and user can hand target and harvest module to selected nodes
   - shepherd herd -> yaml -> per node config

Software - OpenOCD
------------------

- check for compatibility jtag, swd, spy-by-wire to new target ICs (eventually tunneled through PRU)
   - nRF52 (DFU / USB, SWD)
   - STM32L4 (SWD)
   - MSP430, MSP432, CC430 (JTAG, Serial, USB, Spy-By-Wire)
- currently not routed through PRU, just normal beagle-GPIO
- bring https://github.com/geissdoerfer/openocd/commits/am3358gpio mainline
    - git https://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/code/merge-requests/?status=open
    - gerrit http://openocd.zylin.com/#/q/status:open


Software - Web-Interface
------------------------

- security concept needed if interface should be globally accessible
