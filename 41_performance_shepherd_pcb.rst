Design-Changes for HW-Rev2, mostly advantages
    - shunt for current-sensing included in Voltage-Buffer-Loop, so output stays the same -> voltages sensing ADC only needed for calibration
    - 2 separate fast ADCs are perfect for parallel and faster data acquisition, up to 50 MHz SPI
    - Analog-Switch to target had 4 Ohms Resistance? Now 500mOhm
    - old biDir Level-Translators Type TXB needed 3mA drive strength, and even leaked 1-2uA when off
        - TI: TXS and TXB need side A to have a higher Vin as side B because of a protection diode
        - TI: LSF needs side B to be higher Voltage
        - TODO: specs of new one
    - ultra low noise LDO for all analog ICs
    - EMI-Cage for recorder and emulator
    - rugged external input power on shepherd module, protected for reverse polarity
    - watchdog-timer to trigger boot and reset if bbone unresponsive or POE-Switching fails or is not allowed
    - extra low leakage recording and emulation
        - 500 pA for OpAmp
        - < 40 nA for Diodes
        - < 50 nA for Mosfet
        - ~1 nA for analogue switches
        - 1-5 uA for level translators (behind switches)
    - extra low noise OpAmps, DAC and ADC
    - high speed, low power gpio to target
    - support for two targets
    - Target-GPIO performance without target
        - target voltage 3v3, triggering from user-space-pins
        - (quickshot102/103)  < 2 us from 0 to 2V, but last 1/2 Volt can take 100 us
        - (qs104) < 5 us for complete transition, < 2 us for first 2 V
        - -> performance should be good for at least 500 kHz
        - pru-pins - rising edge - first 2V ~ 1us, complete in 2-3 us
        - pru-pins - falling edge - first 2V ~ 1us, complete in 3-4 us
