nRF52 Target with FRAM
========================


Assumptions
------------

- things to cut away

   - power supply - complete block
   - i2c routed to connector (i2c to RTC left)
   - INT to max-IC
   - all 7 pwr-supply signals to connector
   - energy management - first in parts, then completely
   - RTC-PWR-Switch -> is a bad Idea, as we have no way to initially power MCUs (even during programming)
   - shared pwr-IO (mostly to management) -> enough shared pins already

- things to keep

   - RTC
   - programming-pins
   - shared spi, i2c, max-int, rtc-int

- things to change

   - Shp_Bat_OK should go to some gpio (=9)
   - add current-protection between shared io-pins -> all ICs (levelchanger, RTC, MSP, nRF) are comfortable with >10 mA drain/source so we limit at 8-10mA for ~4V max (~500 Ohm) which results in **240 Ohm for each connection of a star-topology**
   - some more debug LEDs
   - RTC gets more `battery`, + 100 uF
   - capacity on MSP_SBW_IO is ref-design (probably debounce for RST) -> set DNP
   - GPIO-Pins to cape-Port, special functions bound by MSP

      - 0:1 are UART
      - 0:3 are SPI (with target as Controller)
      - 9 signals BAT-OK from Shepherd
      - 10 is missing (is now LED)



- misc / Questions

   - open source OK
   - do some of D0:D10 have hidden dedicated functionality? 11 Pins to 9+1 ShpPins have to be mapped somehow. D2:3 seems to be A_In, D0:1 are uart?

      - one of D0:10 influences RF -> D6 is LF-IO, P1.03
      - there are 6x free HS pins, why are they not used? space constraints?
      - NFC pins are special care (pwrgd H0)
      - really just put CLK on nRESET of nRF-Module? should be ok after reprogramming

- to clear up

   - MSP has a lot of compromises because of smaller package
   - MSP GPIO 0/1 is UART (This will be routed to SHP-GPIO 7&8)


    - bauteile sichten (BGA, QFN), advantages QFN
  + simpler design and footprint
	- pin-def incompatible to squeece
	+ already locally in stock
	+ if our qfn stock runs out we could switch to BGA without changing pin-def
	- QFN (-1IRGZT) = 7.80€@100n; BGA (-IZVW) = 9.42€@100n

 + msp reset C -> DNP
 + CoPi
 + spannungsbegreuntzung diode checken
 + PWR-LED mit Mosfet + only 220 R ? as much current as possible

Changes / Bugfixes
------------------

- marking of module footprint is irritating -> copper crosses more inwards
- name LEDs!
- C7 is 0604? use same as C2
- make longer and all parts on one side? -> NO
