Beaglebone PRU
==================================

Getting started - handling PRUs (in ansible: dev_rebuild_pru.yml)::

    sudo su

    # stopping PRUs
    echo "stop" > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc1/state
    echo "stop" > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc2/state

    # stop and start kernel module -> warning: some states are not reset this way
    modprobe -r shepherd
    modprobe -a shepherd
    # fw gets flashed and PRUs started by module

    # test code on live system
    sudo shepherd-sheep -vv run --config /etc/shepherd/config.yml

    # test suite in /opt/shepherd/software/python-package
    sudo python3 setup.py test --addopts "-vv"

    # helpful when build-system was used with sudo
    sudo chown -R user ./

Code Improvements
-----------------

Toolchain

    - switch to gcc-pru, cmake?
    - add all gpio to lib,
    - ``global`` include should be named ``shared``
    - sometimes precedence could be made more clear: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence
    - PRU could control MUX by using pad control registers, in control module (SPRUH73Q, p1458) 0x44E1_0000, 128 kB
    - currently already implemented
        - update pru-software-support-package-5.4.0 to
            - official v5.7, or
            - gcc version https://github.com/dinuxbg/pru-software-support-package (fork of V4), with cherry-picking
            - updating fork: http://www.bartread.com/2014/02/12/git-basics-how-to-merge-changes-from-a-different-fork-into-your-own-branch/
        - fix make files
        - switch from -O2 to -O4, drop debug-symbols, nail char to unsigned, forbid float
        - add more const-correctness, less mixing of signed with unsigned (expensive typecast)
        - avoid signed int < 32bit, also expensive typecast
        - avoid a lot of far/slow register reads, but there can be done more
        - defines are better and more safe to use, explicit typing, proper usage of brackets
        - add lib-fn to access gpio-registers of sys
        - remove a lot of bottlenecks in PRUs
        - initialize vars were possible
        - printf became more userfriendly and selfexplaining
        - avoid global vars, or restrict them by "static" if possible
        - improve constness of fn-parameters throughout the code
        - expensive modulo was used at least 4 times, but never really needed
        - raise warning/hinting-level -> fix warnings and errors
        - code compiles with gcc, but linker has problems with cmake
    - statistics
        - PRU0-Codesize shrank from 161 KB to 99 KB
        - PRU1-Codesize shrank from 131 KB to 91 KB
        - GPIO-Sampling is now at around 5.5 MHz, the routine only needs 100 ns, 720 ns when writing (was originally 360, 1500)
        - pru1-loop takes around 220 to 260 ns on average (with ~30-50 ns debug-overhead), max is 5700 ns
            - event 1 takes 200 ns
            - event 2 takes 250 ns
            - event 3 takes 540 ns (reply-pending-part) without control reply, and 4550 ns with reply (was originally 5200 ns)
        - pru0
            - 560 ns for handle_rpmsg(), sometimes 1020 ns
            - 4340 ns sampling() / harvesting & load
            - 6860 ns sampling() / emulation
            - 4220 ns sampling() / vcap
            - blocking mutex part in buffer-exchange (handling block end) was reduced from 2700 ns to 460 ns
            - sampling happens with 100 kHz, every 10 us, but due to pru1 as a trigger, the jitter is at least the min-loop-timing (~200ns) and increases on gpio-value-writing (~900ns)


pru1

    - most of the control state-machine should be on PRU0 -> get spi-readout triggered by tmr_cmp1 for high precision readout timing
    - virtqueue / rpmsg is heavily unoptimized for 2-8 byte transfers (~5 us)
    - timer-defines in config and main are codependent, it would be easier to base them on the CLK
    - clean up timecalc, it seems complicated, at least the naming of vars
    - fast loop could be more consistent if there would be a "continue" at the end of the events
    - is "/2" an obvious bitshift?
    - TIMER_BASE_PERIOD / 10 seems to be a constant
    - currently already implemented
        - pin writes could be optimized, bit-shift right away (combinable)
        - mix of types, unsigned int VS. fixed uint32_t
        - typecasting for defines, or just literals
        - event 3 should be on position 1 (if possible), highest prio


pru0

    - firmware should do self-tests for its key components
        - both cores running
        - ram-interface to cpu responsive
        - dac and adc available (chk product-id register)
        - setting voltage is measurable
        - bring it down to kernel module or (if not possible, or additionally) as blink-codes
        - show printf as kernelmsg, but don't spam too much
    - so many magic numbers! config seems not like a config, because it needs to know what is in ``resource_table_def``
    - currently already implemented
        - ringbuffer can be optimized
        - ``init_ring`` should be ``ringbuffer_init``, consistency
        - int_source is global, it shouldn't -> it can be reduced to a local bool ``got_sig_block_end``
        - free_buffers is global, but then passed by pointer
        - shared_mem is global
        - int-return is mostly const and not needed
        - context switch by function calls are expensive (inline, variables via const ref)


pru0 vCap

    - it would be perfect to use constexpr-fn to pre-calculate LUTs and literals for proper human readable unit conversion
    - modularize code, because vCap also contains MPPT-Converter, they could be swappable
    - unit-test critical parts (add from teensy project)
    - demystify magic numbers
    - control loop should be faster than 100 kHz, to handle sudden TX-Spikes, depending on local-input-capacitance and pwr-consumption of target-board
        - adc/dac transfer could happen simultaneously with 17 MHz, so data is read, control is calculated and written on next tick
    - find a better name
    - allow freezing energy in capacitor

PRU-Changes for after HW-Completion

    - Control-Code from PRU1 would be partly more suited for PRU0 now
    - could the buffer swap be more efficient? it should be just a switch of base-address
    - is the gpio-buffer properly initialized or nulled in between? or only partially in hdf5 saved by py-routines
    - vCap still needs a lot of care
    - add asserts, simple define-version is enough: https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/asserts-in-embedded-systems
    - prepare power-down options to save more energy
    - add new hardware as abstract layer
    - add option to preCharge Target or just begin with full Cap
    - Presence-Check SPI ADC (ID or similar)
    - downsampling (pyCode)
    - measure sync-offset-limits

Code Questions

    - is timer 0 reset by pru0?
    - build system by choice? c++, cmake ok?
    - who is maintaining the sample-index in pru0? is it same as sample_counter in pru1 (no it seems to be gpio_sample_counter, but event2 is confusing)
    - there is no real ISR?
    - 1 SampleBuffer contains space for 10'000 ADC-Samples and 16'384 GPIO-Edges -> where is it stored, not in SharedMem
    - what does the ringbuffer store? char
    - compile with debug symbols for decompiler
