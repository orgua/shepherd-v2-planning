Level Translators
=================

Problem
-------
- voltages on B-side seemed to work fine from 2.5 V to 5V, but showed errors below,
- Nexperia LSF0108 seems to have hidden properties that are not mentioned in the datasheet
- expected behaviour
    - open drain on both sides when pins float / only PUs active
    - PUs bring pins to ref-voltage
    - a low on side results in a low on the opposite side

Setup
-----
- Side A has constant supply voltage of 3.3 V
- side B supply is dynamic, 0 to 5 V, but voltages below 1 V are not expected to be covered by the translator

Nexperia LSF0108
----------------
- marketed as bidirectional, multivoltage, open-drain, push-pull
- translation between "0.95 V and 1.8, 2.5, 3.3 and 5V" (room for speculation)
- unlike the TI-Versions, this IC does not have voltage constraints (like V_A has to be >= 0.8 V + V_B)
- "An and Bn pins may be exchanged" (mentioned more than once)

Measurements
------------
- V_RefA = 3v3, V_RefB = 4v5
    - both sides highZ, only PUs working -> V_A and V_B settle at 1.2 V -> UNEXPECTED, should be VRef
    - Side A tied to GND -> V_B = 0 V
    - Side A tied to 3v3 -> V_B = 3v3 -> UNEXPECTED, V_B is capped at 3v3
    - Side B tied to GND -> V_A = 0
    - Side B tied to 4V5 -> V_A = 3 V
- V_RefA = 3v3, V_RefB = 2v0
    - both sides highZ, only PUs working -> V_A and V_B settle at 0.9 V -> UNEXPECTED, should be VRef
    - Side A tied to GND -> V_B = 0 V
    - Side A tied to 2v0 -> V_B = 1v9 -> UNEXPECTED, but ok
    - Side A tied to 3v3 -> V_B = 2v0
    - Side B tied to GND -> V_A = 0 V
    - Side B tied to 2V0 -> V_A = 1.4 V -> UNEXPECTED, still below detection threshold

Fixing the LSF
--------------
- most answers are implied by: https://training.ti.com/multi-voltage-translation-lsf-family
- proper Bias Voltage -> V_B (B for Bias?) needs 200 kOhm PU and V_B > V_A + 0.8 (TI-Rules don't hurt)
    - current will flow from B to A, limited by the 200 kOhm
    - voltage between RefA-to-B will be threshold voltage of FETs (V_B = V_Bias = V_A + V_thres)
    - video 8 in the series even shows a single VB supply schematic with a voltage divider on A-Side
        - R1 = 1 MOhm (i.e.), is high side Resistor
        - VRefA is lowest voltage in System
        - VB = 3.3V, is single supply voltage
        - R2 = 200k * R1 * VRefA / ((200k + R1)(VB - VRefA) - 0.85*R1), is low side resistor
            - R2 = 105k for VRefA = 1V, 75k for 0.8 V, 144k for 1.2 V
            - nexperia seems to have slightly higher diode voltage of 1V instead of 0.85 (in formular)
            - -> R2 = 100k for VRef=0.93 V (nexperia) or 0.97 V (TI)
- V_A should be lowest voltage in System, so V_A gets 1V from an additional supply
- PUs are possible on neither, one, both sides
    - not needed on sides that only drive (push pull)
    - not needed on receiving low side with input leakage lower 1 uA
    - needed when level is not on corresponding level V_A or driver is only open drain
- both Ref-Voltages are independent from real voltages used on each side
- PUs on target side should not be driven by current-sensed line

One Supply Calc::

    R1: 1e6;
    VRefA: 0.97;
    VB: 3.3;
    R2: 200e3 * R1 * VRefA / ((200e3 + R1)*(VB - VRefA) - 0.85*R1);
    -> R2 = 100k

Inner Workings
--------------
- CMOS Driver (Push-Pull) on one side, CMOS Receiver (High-Z) on other side, with PU on each side
- Driver LOW -> current will sink into transmitter, current is generated by both PUs, FET / Translator will generate a small voltage drop
- Driver HIGH -> FET / Translator will turn off (cut line) reaching VA, transmit-line is controlled by driver, receiver side by PU from then on


	
Alternatives
------------
- constraints: BiDir, Auto-sensing, one side 3v3, other side 1.7 - 5 V (nRF52)
    - TXB -> needs relativly high driving current
    - TXS -> has internal PU, but relies on VRef-Relation
    - LSF -> only conducts on lowside, needs external PU
    - ICs from TI seem to always need special VRef-Relation
    - Nexperia ICs are new and on order (but offer better specs)
- special uniDir solutions
    - spi, sn74lv4t125, spi, https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LV4T125#product-details##features
    - 1bit unidir, sn74lv1t34, https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LV1T34#product-details##features
- voltage constraints could be solved by a two-stage approach 3v3 <-> 0v9 <-> 1.x - 5V
