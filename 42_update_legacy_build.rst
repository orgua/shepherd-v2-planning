Legacy Code-Branch
==================

Intro
-----
- for hw revision 1.x
- where: https://github.com/orgua/shepherd/tree/hw_revision_1.x
- branched on 15. Jan 2021 [52f087a]
- currently 227 commits behind main
    - main is not stable, fall back to [1c02230] 21. Feb 2021 (branch "fw_ok")
- comparison
    - legacy (15. Jan) vs fw_ok -> https://github.com/orgua/shepherd/compare/hw_revision_1.x...orgua:fw_ok
    - legacy (20. Apr) vs master -> https://github.com/orgua/shepherd/compare/hw_revision_1.x...orgua:master

Improvements
-------------

- 1.x branch is now on par with v2-branch from 2021-05-06, except for
    - rpmsg-replacement for buffer exchange -> must be thoroughly tested first
    - optimized spi-asm-code (faster, simultaneous clk/data-edges) -> ICs have changed in v2

- make-system fixed and improved
- ansible playbooks improved
- pru: many bottlenecks and overhead removed -> headroom for more complex code
    - gpio is now sampled with 1.0 to 5.5 MHz (mean ~ 4 MHz)
    - is mostly depending on spi-transfer but whole emulation takes 6860 ns of max of 10000 ns (100 kHz)
    - timesync is mostly done by kernel (less overhead for pru)
- pru: some race conditions could be identified and removed
- pru: biggest time-waster in
    - 4340 ns sampling() / harvesting & load
    - 6860 ns sampling() / emulation
    - 2740 ns handling block end -> pru1-blocking part was reduced to 460 ns
- c-code-quality
    - less global vars
    - usage of fixed width ints
    - more const-correctness
    - better naming
    - less magic numbers
- adc-sampling of pru0 reacts directly to interrupt now instead of extra trigger from pru1 -> less jitter and less error
    - both PRUs had separate sample-counters and were more vulnerable to race-conditions
    - pru1 does not use rpmsgs for sync-system with kernel-module but a simple system via shared-memory
        - before: checking for a message took ~550 ns and receiving (and processing) it took ~ 4800 ns
        - new system checks in 40 ns and receives & processes in 1140 ns
        - the transmission of the system also works faster -> previously the pru was checking for messages ~8 times, now the answer is there on first or second try
        - gpio-sampling was improved by that: min frequency increased from <200 kHz to 600 kHz, mean is now at ~4.00 MHz
        - for reference: timings were taken with enabled debug-code
- python
    - improved console output
    - more explicit code
    - more graceful handling of common errors or user-induced exits
- API-Changes Python -> same as v2 codebase
    - input -> input_path
    - output -> output_path (still -o)
    - length -> duration (now -d instead of -l)
    - force -> force_overwrite (still -f)
    - eeprom_wp -> eeprom_write (properly reflect behaviour)
    - NOTE1: if only an output-directory is specified the recording will be saved with an ISO 8601 timestamp (ie. rec_2021-04-20_12-12-12.h5)
    - NOTE2: this fixes (theoretical) conflict with -l for shepherd-herd (--limit) and sheep (--length)
- removed virtcap-code, as it was not working as intended
- more sanity-checks throughout codebase, i.e.
    - unusual jumps for buffer-timestamps are shown (in kernel before sending to pru, in python after receiving from pru)
    - time-sync gets reported from kernel-module when not stabile (yet)
    - show when a message to pru stays unread (backpressure) or it is altered (hint for mem-corruption)
    - [...]

Known Bugs
----------
- ending python programs with ctrl&c can result in (false) error-messages - graceful shutdown is yet to come
- starting the sheep with

Open Issues

- None


Pipenv-Trouble
--------------
- pipenv fails to scan for deps in sub-folders when python wasn't pinned to v3 (
- black-lib had troubles -
    - kai uses "--pre" for installation
    - i used "pipenv install "black==20.8b1" (if i recall correctly)
- dbus-python package had trouble with sub-dependency (dbus-1), when the following apt-package wasn't installed: libdbus-glib-1-dev

Pipenv (TODO: not perfect place here)::

    pipenv --three
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
    pipenv run pip list
    pipenv --rm
    pipenv update
    pipenv graph
