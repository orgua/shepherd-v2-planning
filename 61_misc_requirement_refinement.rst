Requirements Refresh / Refinement 2022-06
=========================================

(rough version)

- more focus on a general testbed for the Internet of Things, especially:
- GPIO Monitoring -> higher min sampling frequency / guarantees
	- nRF and MSP430 have 16 MHz baseclock -> same region would be nice
	- chip-rate of 2 MChip/s,
	- 200ns per loop == must, 150 ns == nice, more welcome
	- idea: state-machine triggered sampling with max window size (example: target uses one pin to trigger sampling for 50 ms)
- UART Monitoring (RX from Target-Side), min 461 kBaud, better 922 kBaud (1MBaud maybe easier)
	- software defined, linked with GPIO-Monitoring
	- timestamp with 1ms-resolution is enough, whole line, start of transmission
	- more detailed timestamps are often embedded in message itself
	- document wrap (if needed), for someone that uses no \n\r, OR
	- OR user-defined wrap-symbol
	- test for ascii control chars (storage in h5 and csv-file) -> or document forbidden chars
		- also base64, 85, 91, or raw
	- continuous stream should also be functional (1MBaud, long duration, creates 10Mbyte stream currently -> might be a problem) -> specify max rate if not possible
- actuation (like UART-Sending):
	- telnet seems not useful (tests can run at night, )
	- top-feature: script on observer with additional logic would be nice (read and write gpio / uart)
	- nice-feature: config-file with time-based send-commands
	- min feature: gpio-actuation per PRU, synced
	- idea: state-machine preload, without reads during run,
- lower sampling bounds should be guaranteed and known -> avoid spurious phantom signals
- Sync-Error should be lower than Clock of GPIO-Register of target

     - Example: 1 / 16 MHz -> 62 ns

- GPIO Actuation, set predefined pins, precise between nodes, resolution can be rather low (100 kHz more than enough, even 10 Hz could be enough), parameters:

    - t_offset (since start of measurement)
    - node(s)
    - GPIO(s)
    - State

- GPIO Actuation for Live View could be beneficial (users can check if system is alive, but what else?) (only nice to have)

Thoughts on Feasibility
=======================

GPIO Monitoring

- with constant voltage (only current-monitoring, no virtual source model) one PRU-Core would be idle -> custom firmware
- PRU0 handles monitoring el. current, actuating GPIOs, Sync timebase, exchange data-buffers
- PRU1 handles only GPIO-Monitoring -> busy waiting

UART Monitoring

- current design routes UART to ARM controlled Pins (Linux) and PRU (GPIO Monitoring, discrete timestamped Events)
- Linux UART RX will be tested -> we are currently stuck at kernel 4.19 but have to switch to 5.10+ eventually
- for PRU monitoring the dedicated section applies

Sync-Error

- there is still a low frequency with unknown origin (~ 0.2 Hz)
- current limits are hard to improve
    - error between nodes: +- 400 ns abs, q95% ~ +- 200 ns
    - error between local triggers: ~ +- 120 ns abs, q95% ~ +- 50 ns
- tbd: deployed cisco-switch in TUD has layer 3 routing and >doubled spec -> could improve sync

TODO
====

- implement enablers / general improvements

    - decouple GPIO-Ringbuffer from IV-Stream-Buffer -> size constraint of 16k Events per 100 ms
    - current buffer-swap implementation is not optimal, takes too much time and should be replaced by a big ring-buffer -> makes mutex between PRUs redundant

- test UART RX with kernel 4.19 / 5.10 with 461 and 922 kBaud
- fork PRU-Firmware with focus on GPIO-Speed

    - test capabilities
