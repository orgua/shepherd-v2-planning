Hunting a Memoryleak
====================

First Proof
-----------

- RAM-Increase 5% (24mb) in 10 min, slower but steady increase later on
- sheep starts with 13.2 % of system memory -> after 5000 s it uses 28 % already
- setup: 10 h input file, no output-writing for V & C & GPIO
- mem-profiler shows slightly asymptotic behaviour -> maybe normal lazy garbage collection depending on free ram?
- after not even 6h the BB became unstable due to saturated RAM

**TLDR: h5py was the culprit -> reading from files**

Investigation
-------------

- only a few possibilities to leaking memory in python -> look for circular references and custom __del__()-methods
- try to avoid exception-handling as a default-strategy in mainloop -> only in shepherdio._get_msg() -> no difference
- file-descriptors or other things without calling close() can leak -> not the case here
- tracemalloc-profiler is in stdlib -> brings no clue as mem usage and peak settle at a low value
    - constant timejumps and higher cpu-usage after 30000 s or 464 of 484 mb RAM
- profile code with pympler, tracker, muppy, ... (https://pythonhosted.org/Pympler/muppy.html)
    - finds nothing, code must hide in cpython (compiled libs) out of scope for profiles
- valgrind -> powerful, but too slow to work

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo valgrind --tool=memcheck shepherd-sheep -vv run --config /etc/shepherd/example_config_emulation.yml
    sudo valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes shepherd-sheep -vv run --config /etc/shepherd/example_config_emulation.yml

- fil, python memory profiler, https://pythonspeed.com/fil/docs/fil/what-it-tracks.html
    - trouble as arm is not natively supported, but github-issue for arm-macos gives a fix

.. code-block:: bash

    #sudo /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install filprofiler
    sudo apt install rustc
    pip install git+https://github.com/pythonspeed/filprofiler.git#egg=filprofiler
    fil-profile run --no-browser shepherd-sheep -vv run --config /etc/shepherd/example_config_emulation.yml
    -> fails to compile for armV7 -> missing SYS_mmap2

Disable Submodules (logging, memread, h5pywrite, compression) one by one

- loglevel = 0
- disable h5-writer & compression
- Mods to allow uninterrupted testing
    - pru0/main.c, line99, //send_status(...NOFREEBUF
    - pypkg/init.py, line 626, start_time = + 25
- not use click and logging (logging.getLogger(__name__).addHandler(NullHandler()))
    - rec: mem-usage is growing 11.3? to 12.9 % in 10min, 50% CPU
    - emu1: 13.0 to 13.6.. %, 22 % CPU
    - emu2: 14.1 to 15.3, 55 % CPU ?? -> why not ~80 % ?
- also replace shared_mem.read_buffer() by random-data
    - emu1: 11.7 to 13.7 % -> ram-usage stays between
    - emu2: to 16.3 %
- also replace .get_msg/buffer and emu.return_buffer() by dummy, also gc.collect() in between
    - untrottled run on 100% cpu
    - emu1: 11.7 to 13.7
    - emu2: 13.7 to 16.4
- also skip hdf5-writing
    - emu1: 11.6 - 13.5
    - emu2: 13.6 - 14.6 -> improved memory - for real?
- also skip databuffer-Class
    - e12: up to 14.8
- reading or writing is problem? one h5py-issue mentions vlen-type
    - rec. 10.x - 12.5
- removing lzf again
    - rec. 10.7 - 11.3
- isolated datalogger, 25 min sim,
    - rec 5.6 - 7.9 % (seems to be maxed there), emu
    - emu 6.0 % - 16 % (after 2330 s) -> **thats the bug! reading from h5py, (lzf?)**
- with this result the code could be isolated and the bug is reproducible with pypthon 3.10, windows and even on x86/64bit
