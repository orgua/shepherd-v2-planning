Concept - Hardware - Shepherd-Cape
==================================

-> mostly documentation of changes to V1.x

Computing Power and Accuracy Constraints - a pro and contra
    - Beaglebone Green
        - pro: 40 €, HW-Timestamping, 2 real time Cores, awesome support and community, stable and fairly low energy consumption
        - con: fairly old CPU, 100 MBit Ethernet, RTUs could be to slow for the requirements, storage is slow, encrypted network traffic is slow (< 50 MBit)
        - biggest challenges:
            - pre and post data-transfer
            - high speed emulation in PRUs with the slow L3-Access, unflexible GPIO, missing FPU and int-division
    - Beaglebone AI
        - pro: same as BBG, GBE, faster CPU, 4 Real time Cores
        - con: 3x Price of BBG, still the same PRU IP with its limitations
        - unknown: faster storage, faster network traffic
    - Zynq 7020
        - pro: similar price as BBAI, 1 GBE, FPGA in same Package, hw-timestamping
        - con: xilinx-toolchain, documentation is overwhelming, community small, long dev-cycle
        - https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/de/30195-MYC-C7Z020-CPU-Modul-mit-XC7Z020-2CLG400I-industrieller-Temperaturbereich?c=238
    - PRU replacement or extension
        - CPLD would be overkill
        - Teensy 4 -> lots of iO, SPI with DMA, interrupts for everything, FPU, 600 MHz, proper toolchain, https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html
        - FPGA in between embedded CPU and Shepherd
            - some lattice even have a open source toolchain
            - FPGA could be transparent if not needed
        - argument to keep everything as is for now: "inbetween" could be added later by sandwiching PCBs


shepherd Cape
    - add fixed & robust power-connector and possibility to switch system on/off, reverse-polarity-detection
    - external (SMA) connector for PPS (in addition to Link from GPS), possible switch / level-changer -> record via PRU
    - power stage:
        - remove / untie EH-recording (and mppt-conv) -> recorder can stay on pcb or be even modularized)
        - EH-recording after Converter not absolutely needed
        - current load solution seem a bit overkill and brings non-linearity with the LEDs
        - simplify "emulator" power-stage with virtual Converter
    - easier (dis)assembly by reducing / removing pin-header-forwarding (only take what is needed)
        - reduce or bundle pins to shepherd (or another way to make disassembly easier) -> used pins don't have to be forwarded
        - using a pointy thin rod that can get between pin-rows helps to non-destructive get cape off
    - compatibility with and optimization for beagle AI (dedicated concept-file)
    - addressable i2c - flash storage for calibration and distinction
        - all flashes can share same bus, shepherd gets first address, target second, ...


Energy-Recorder/Emulator:
    - easiest case: replay / emulation could "just" rely on voltage-DAC and target-current-draw measurement?
    - current implementation: recording with U/I before DC-Conv, emulation with U/I meas. after DC-Conv
    - if recorder stays: converter could be modular, interface would offer shunt_in (V_sIn, V_sOut) and V_cOut Converter output, and some control pins
        - is the DAC for voltage reference really needed? LDO enough?

Capelet - System
    - get rid of pin-headers for b2b / mezzanine - interconnect -> molex, flex cable, hirose ...
    - support for addressable i2c-flash for distinction and configuration
    - maybe rotate capelets, so they stick orthogonal on shepherd (would benefit antenna)

GPS Capelet
    - look for similar gps-module with external antenna support (currently ublox SAM M8Q) -> ublox Neo M8Q, same but with external antenna, 30-60 ns accuracy
    - backup power (LiPo / Supercap)
    - there are special timing modules
        - uBlox ZED-F9T (~ 140 €, < 5ns clear sky)
        - uBlox LEA-M8F (~60 €, < 20 ns clear sky)
        - uBlox LEA/NEO-M8T (~50 €, < 20 ns clear sky) -> already in inventory
        - trimble also offers precise timing gps modules
    - preferred solution: module without antenna and sma-port, smd-antenna on same pcb with sma-port, short interconnect or remote antenna
    - PPS currently on Timer4 P8_7, GPS on UART2

target Capelet
    - allow a second target -> switch inputs and power (could also lead to a third if space is available)
    - try to keep power (constant) for the not connected target, so it can run independently
    - allow different targets (probably limited by software) even fpga or other untypical combinations
    - handling with standardized data interfaces:
        - maximize gpio-count between beagle and target, parallel usage also for programmer-pins and uart if possible / needed (and spi if feasable)
        - host-cpu should offer SWD, JTAG, GPIO, SPI, UART to target (unified pins), PRU is recorder and power-supply-emulator (if PRU cant access host gpio periphery)
        - reasons: PRU is very static (pin-dir is predefined), python needs access to all pins
    - target could also use i2c-bus to enable eprom-storage for config- and ID-Data
    - fast level-changer for >= 1 Mbps UART (BB-Uart max is 3.7 Mbps)
    - bidirectional gpio-connection, tri-state (input, output, disconnected)
        - perfect if also flexible muxer included
        - make gpio-connections to target switchable if possible -> no transfer of energy (if needed)
        - possible usb-interface (has to be cable based, beagle does not offer usb on pin-header)
    - if there is low cost one, make power-connection switchable (for on-off-pattern if power-emulation does not work)
    - if usb to target (via cable), then make it off-switchable
    - routing of v_in_SHT+/- can be removed - it was never used and is a big noise-source for ADC
    - low prio: rf attenuator and connector for antenna -> depending on target capabilities

Beaglebone timekeeping
    - test high precision, temperature compensated crystal oscillator with same footprint
    - test higher quality gps with lower jitter on pps line
    - sync line could be supplied by gps cape in combination with schmitt-trigger-hub to power multiple targets

Special Constraints for parts
    - subtractor for V_EMU_I needed, because DAC does not reach 0 -> differential DAC would be nice
    - ADC-mode is differential -> <0 currently not needed, one bit wasted, but not bad to have, for reversed current-flow
    - Diodes between beagle-pins and level-changer needed on some pins, because they are active at boot



CAD of Choice
-------------

Problem:
    - eagle has only simplified constraints management (important for proper ERC, DRC)
    - no user moderated part properties (Accuracy, max Power, max Gate Voltage ...)
    - no proper BOM management (in Altium one component equals one real / orderable part)
    - constraint from kai: linux-support very much preferred

Eagle
    - pro: holds current design, probably good enough
    - con: not free for everyone, has no proper constraints and parameter handling (part properties, order number, bom generation)

kiCAD
    - pro: open source, can import eagle, several extensions
    - con: still no proper constraints in V5, less intuitive GUI
    - detour: skidl_

Skidl
    - pro: offers a schematic design language in python -> jump right to kiCAD PCB Layout, seems to support user moderated properties, has constraints
    - con: v0.2 - but it seems to be usable, documentation is loose

altium
    - pro: tool of choice, free license with university-email, proper constraints and parameter manager, simulation
    - con: most functionality is overkill, windows-os only

circuit maker
    - pro: free, directly for open source projects, similar to big altium brother
    - con: deliberately crippled to be unproductive for large designs

Concept - Hardware - eagle project
==================================

- improvements to project
- allow proper DRC and ERC by redefining pins in symbol-lib
    - NC - not connected
    - In - input
    - Out - output
    - IO - in/out
    - OC - open collector or open drain
    - Hiz - high impedance output
    - Pas - passive (resistor, etc)
    - Pwr - power pin (supply input)
    - Sup - supply output (also for ground)
- swap-level (>0) allow easy pin-changes in later design stages (pins with same swap level)
- function -> inverted (dot), clock, invClk
- add parameters for partnumber, order-number (mouser, digikey), some key specs (forward current, max power, max voltage, ..), price -> eagle does not seem to support that at all?!?
    - reason to switch to kicad?
- minimize BOM
