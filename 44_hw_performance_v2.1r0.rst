HW Performance v2.1r0
=====================

Setup
-----

- BB powered by benchsupply 5.1 V, ~ 400 mA
- Shepherd powered by BB, VIn 5.08V
- Mods
    - big cap on input
    - switched rails for emu
    - later: lowpasses raised to 160 kHz
    - intermediate: rail B with short loop (exclude switch)
    - intermediate: small 100 nF Buffer Cap for Target 1 (instead of 1 uF)
    - later: 1 Ohm Shunt on Rail B, 100 Ohm for InAmp for 1:100 Amp
    - later: railB, long loop, 1.6 MHz Feedback Lowpass with 100 Ohms
- recorder
    - 1 kOhm from V_virtBuf to V_harvest
    - v_harvest connected to V_sense
- Emu
    - 1 kOhm on V_supply on target 1

- scope screenshots are in ./media_v2.1r0


Voltage Drop on Enable
----------------------

- switching power on can result in unstable states for BB and ICs
- scope shows (Quickprint[1-3].png)
    - 3 Drop-Stages with ~ 620 mV drop in around 700 us
    - slowly recovering 300 mV after that
- adding a 1 mF / 16 V Cap on 5 V Input improves situation (Quickprint4.png)
    - drop of 200 mV for ~ 4 ms
    - 2 remaining Spikes with 328 mV
    - no recovery after that -> quick return to previous rail-voltage


DAC-Responses
-------------

- Harvest-VMatch
    - 1V raise  - < 8 us, < 10 % overshoot (QuickPrint23.png)
    - 1V fall   - < 8 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint22.png)
    - 3V raise  - < 8 us, no overshoot (QuickPrint20.png)
    - 3V fall   - < 8 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint21.png)
    - 4V8 raise - < 12 us, no overshoot (QuickPrint24.png)
    - 4V8 fall  - < 10 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint26.png)
    - result: reference for a fast response, higher voltages are limited by raise-time

- Harvest-SimBuf, 1 kOhm Drain
    - 1V raise  - < 30 us, < 12 % overshoot (QuickPrint31.png)
    - 1V fall   - < 25 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint32.png)

    - 3V fall   - < 25 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint33.png)
    - 4V8 raise - < 30 us, no overshoot (QuickPrint29.png)
    - 4V8 fall  - < 20 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint28.png)
    - result: probably limited by lowpass, should be faster
- Harvest-SimBuf, 1 kOhm Drain, 160 kHz Mod
    - 1V raise  - < 15 us, 40 % overshoot (QuickPrint93.png)
    - 1V fall   - ~ 12 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint94.png)
    - 3V raise  - ~ 14 us, 15 % overshoot (QuickPrint96.png)
    - 3V fall   - ~ 10 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint95.png)
    - 4V8 raise - ~ 14 us, 5 % overshoot (QuickPrint97.png)
    - 4V8 fall  - ~ 12 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint98.png)
    - result: significantly better performance, but still no match with speed of VMatch, probably because of additional 100 nF -> preview of possible Mod for Emu-Rails (reduce 1uF to 100 nF)

- Emulate, Rail A
    - 1V raise - 50 us, 20 % overshoot (QuickPrint5.png)
    - 1V fall  - 90 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint8.png)

    - 4V fall  - 70 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint11.png)
    - 5V raise - 70 us, no overshoot (QuickPrint13.png)
    - 5V fall  - 70 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint15.png)
    - result: lowpass might slow down control loop, cut off delay is ~ 60 us (16 kHz)

- Emulate, Rail B, 1 kOhm Drain,
    - 1V raise - 50 us, 20 % overshoot (QuickPrint16.png)
    - 1V fall  - 90 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint17.png)
    - 2V raise - 50 us, 20 % overshoot (QuickPrint19.png)
    - 2V fall  - 70 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint18.png)
    - result: very similar to Rail A
    - perspective: v2.0 was 100 us to rise (75us for 80%) and 400us to fall (75us for 80%)
- Emulate, Rail B, 1 kOhm Drain, 160 kHz Mod
    - 1V raise  - 45 us, 20 % overshoot (QuickPrint88.png)
    - 1V fall   - 80 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint87.png)
    - 3V raise  - 50 us, 10 % overshoot (QuickPrint89.png)
    - 3V fall   - 80 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint90.png)
    - 4V8 raise - 60 us, no overshoot (QuickPrint92.png)
    - 4V8 fall  - 70 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint91.png)
    - result: the lowpass only has a small influence, try small loop next
- Emulate, Rail B, 1 kOhm Drain, 160 kHz Mod, Small Loop Mod
    - 1V raise  - 30 us, 20 % overshoot (QuickPrint104.png)
    - 1V fall   - 80 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint103.png)
    - 3V raise  - 50 us, 10 % overshoot (QuickPrint101.png)
    - 3V fall   - 70 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint102.png)
    - 4V8 raise - 70 us, no overshoot (QuickPrint100.png)
    - 4V8 fall  - 70 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint99.png)
    - result: a bit faster for lower voltages, enough for ditching the switch-compensation?
- Emulate, Rail B, 1 kOhm Drain, 160 kHz Mod, Small Loop Mod, Smaller Cap Mod
    - 1V raise  - ~ 8 us, 20 % overshoot (QuickPrint201.png)
    - 1V fall   - ~ 10 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint202.png)
    - 3V raise  - ~ 10 us, 10 % overshoot (QuickPrint205.png)
    - 3V fall   - ~ 12 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint204.png)
    - 4V8 raise - ~ 14 us, no overshoot (QuickPrint206.png)
    - 4V8 fall  - ~ 12 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint207.png)
    - result: small cap brings edge-response from 30-80 us down to 8-14 us -> target can buffer on its own
- Emulate, Rail B, 1 kOhm Drain, 160 kHz Mod, Small Loop Mod, 1 Ohm Shunt Mod
    - 1V raise  - ~ 6 us, 30 % overshoot (QuickPrint301.png)
    - 1V fall   - ~ 8 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint302.png)
    - 3V raise  - ~ 8 us, 10 % overshoot (QuickPrint303.png)
    - 3V fall   - ~ 10 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint304.png)
    - 4V8 raise - ~ 10 us, 5 % overshoot (QuickPrint305.png)
    - 4V8 fall  - < 10 us for ~ 90 % (QuickPrint306.png)
    - result: voltage seems unstable, but responses are fast! could also be caused by noisy 10/-6 V

- Emulate, Rail B, No Drain, 160 kHz Mod, Long loop, 2 Ohm Shunt, 1 uF Buffer
    - 2V raise  - 40 us, 10 % Overshoot (Quickprint354)
    - 2V fall   - 80 us, 90 % (Quickprint353)
- Emulate, Rail B, No Drain, 160 kHz Mod, Long loop, 2 Ohm Shunt, 100 nF Buffer
    - 2V raise  - < 10 us, < 20 % Overshoot (Quickprint355)
    - 2V fall   - < 10 us, 90 % (Quickprint356)
    - result: 100 nF without any load still shows slight constant ringing
- Emulate, Rail B, 1k Drain, [same as before]
    - 2V raise  - < 10 us, < 20 % Overshoot (Quickprint358)
    - 2V fall   - < 10 us, 90 % (Quickprint357)

- Emulator: total propagation beginning with ChipSelect
    - DAC-CS & OpAmpOut (100nF Buffer, 1kOhm Load), Quickprint364
    - SPI Communication takes ~ 800 ns
    - Voltage begins changing after ~ 2.2 us of CS-High
    - Voltages overshoots in 3 us and falls to wanted voltage in additional 1.5 us
    - result: 8 us from beginning of communication to voltage-set


TODO: try long loop, smaller feedback-resistor, but it shouldn't change much - extra ADC for voltage and 10 Ohm Shunt seems important
latest Mod: rail B, long loop, 1.6 MHz Feedback Lowpass with 100 Ohms
- still 60 mVpp Ripple on VTarget, 600 kHz
- fav: 100nF, ensure system function, noise is ok, buffering done by target
TODO: measure reverse current of diode
TODO: fix lowpass on recorder, or at least the 12mV Spikes every 3.3 us (~7% integral of 12 mV)

TODO: test delay of (recorder) setting voltage-level

Current Measurement
-------------------

- Emulator
    - ohm-meter says R = 995 Ohm
    - I0 = 2.338 # mA
    - V = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4.8] # V
    - I = [3.255, 4.155, 5.068, 5.977, 6.797, 6.711] # mA
    - -> R = [1090.513, 1100.715, 1098.901, 1099.203, 1121.328, 1097.645] # Ohm
    - result:
        - at 5 V system has a 100 mV drop when adding 1 kOhm Load. gone below 4.9 V
        - resulting R for 2-4.8 V is very consistent (not considering noise, or further filtering)

- Emulator -> after Shunt-Mod (1 Ohm)
    - ohm-meter says R = 995 Ohm
    - I0 = 2.346 # mA
    - V = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4.8] # V
    - I = [3.173, 3.996, 4.821, 5.647, 6.429, 6.308] # mA
    - -> R = [1209.19, 1212.121, 1212.121, 1211.754, 1224.59, 1211.509] # Ohm
    - result:
        - resulting R for 2-4.8 V is very consistent, similar to first measurement

- Recorder
    - Ohm-meter says R = 998 Ohm
    - I0 = 2.274 # mA
    - VCombinations = 0/5, 4.9/1, 4/1, 3/1, 2/1, 2/0, 1/0, 4/3
    - V = [-5, 3.9, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1] # VDiff
    - I = [1.84, 5.821, 5.001, 4.092, 3.181, 4.092, 3.182, 3.180] # mA
    - -> R = [11520.737, 1099.521, 1100.11, 1100.11, 1102.536, 1100.11, 1101.322, 1103.753] # Ohm
    - result:
        - reverse current is significantly higher than expected (400 nA instead of 40 nA), even seconds diode can't fix that :( replace it?
        - resulting R is very consistent, similar to emulator-results

pyCode::

    R = list([])
    for index in range(len(V)):
        res = 1000 * V[index] / (I[index] - I0)
        R.append(round(res,3))

GPIO to Target
--------------

- PRU-Recording
    - GPIO 0 -> 1   (r31_00) -> GPIO0
    - GPIO 1 -> 2   (r31_01) -> GPIO1
    - GPIO 2 -> 64  (r31_06) -> GPIO2
    - GPIO 3 -> 128 (r31_07) -> GPIO3
    - GPIO 4 -> 256 (r31_08) -> GPIO4
    - GPIO 5 -> 16  (r31_04) -> UART_TX
    - GPIO 6 -> 32  (r31_05) -> UART_RX
    - GPIO 7 -> 4   (r31_02) -> SWD_CLK
    - GPIO 8 -> 8   (r32_03) -> SWD_IO
    - result: 0,1,5-8 are not connected (P8-41 to P8-46) and can't be handled by PRU
        - fix: connect afterwards (avoid boots-issues)
- Logic-Analyzer Target 1
    - GPIO 0 to 4 correspond to Pin 3 to 7
    - GPIO 5 to 8 correspond to Pin 9 to 12
    - BATOK -> Pin 8
    - result: ALL OK
- Logic-Analyzer Target 2
    - GPIO 0 to 4 correspond to Pin 3 to 7
    - GPIO 5 to 8 correspond to Pin 9 to 12
    - BATOK  -> Pin 8
    - result: ALL OK (after removing solder bridge)
- Getting Pin6 to work
    - disable uart in uEnv.txt
    - enable pins in DT
    - fault: solder bridge under IC (could not be seen from side / above)
- edge-timings
    - config: target A, pin4 / GPIO1, triggered by linux, scope on linux and target pin
    - 3 V rise: 25 us, fully, quickprint307
    - 3 V fall: 4 us, fully, quickprint308
    - 2 V rise: 20 us, fully, quickprint309
    - 2 V fall: < 4 us, fully, quickprint310
    - 4 V rise: 25 us, fully, quickprint311
    - 4 V fall: 4 us, fully, quickprint312
    - 4.8 rise: 25 us, fully, quickprint313
    - 4.8 fall: 4 us, fully, quickprint314
    - confirmed with same pin on target B and pin3
    - result: 20 kbaud ?!? is it enough that 66% of signal is there after 5 us?
- faulty behaviour: both target-gpios are limited to 3V ?
    - V_IO_Buf is also limited to 3V
    - V_IO is on full rail > 4.6 V
    - 1k shunt too high! 10 * 10 k are pulling down, resulting in 1 k
    - replace V_IO_BUF OPAmp-Resistor by 10 Ohms
    - confirmation: full range of voltage
- edge-timings (revisit)
    - 4.8 V rise: 40 us for fully, 12.5 us for 80 %, Quickprint315
    - 4.8 V fall: 10 us for fully, 8 us for 80 %, Quickprint316
- 10x ScopeProbe with reduced capacitance has low impact on rise-time
- faulty behaviour: previous version had edge-timing of 3-4 us both ways!
    - difference: TargetGPIO was pulled up with 100k instead of 10k and 1k to lvl-changer
    - Theory: something is pulling down, maybe FET-Connection is not working as expected

Trying to find reason of slow rising edges
- Taking apart the LSF
    - refB is sources with 240k on 3.306 V, settling at 1.524 V
    - refA settles at 0.967 V (between 1M and 100k) -> voltage drop over FET (refAB) is 0.558 mV
    - modding refB with 200k increases refB to 1.625 V, refA to 1.053 V -> drop = .572 V
- LSF-SignalPads A to B -> resistance while on = 6 Ohm, off = infinite
- 100k as PU on Target side worsens the edge-timing

Program EEPROM
--------------

usage::

    sudo shepherd-sheep -vvv eeprom read
    sudo shepherd-sheep -vvv eeprom write -v 00B0 -s 210617AA0001 --no-calib

- access fails 'FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0054/eeprom'
- EEPROM is on port P9_19/20 and write_protection on P9_23
- /dev lists i2c-0 and i2c-2
    - BB EEPROM is on I2C-0
    - SWD-Interface for Target is on I2C-1
- 'sudo i2cdetect 2' shows a 0x54 device, this should be the EEPROM
- ODD: uEnv.txt shows active I2C1 as overlay, but only 0 and 2 are activate /lib/firmware
- error theory: eeprom has no power during boot and is therefore not added to sysfs
    - fixed by hardwiring 3V3 from BB to offline L3V3 line
- WORKS as expected

External Power
--------------

- Switching Ferrite is not as intuitive as imagined -> mark better

TODO: measure changes in Noise

Watchdog
--------

- BB_nSTART = P9_09, BB_nRES = B9_10, WD_ACK = P8_10
- watchdog is set to 60min per schematic, but is now modded to 20 min (parallel 2x 100k as R101)
- launcher is sending an ACK every 600s ->
    - confirmed: 2.5 ms High from launcher
    - nice extra: ACK-Pin is high for 10s during uboot
- boot works with connected WD
- during normal BB run
    - ACKs come in like clockwork
    - @ 350 s -> some jitter on logic-analyzer ACK was high for ~ 100 ns, nRES also 100 ns 8x during 0.1 ms without harm (Soldering Iron was switched off)
    - @ 1100 s -> BB_nSTART was pulled low for 15 us without any harm
    - @ 2179 s -> BB_nSTART was again pulled low for 15 us
- on shutdown state
    - ACK and nRES are low
    - nSTART is @3V3
    - 730 s silence
    - nSTART gets 20.8 ms low (quickprint317) but its not enough for the "old" BB to react to it
        - not enough for a fresh BB either...
    - there does not seem to come another PullDown (25'000 seconds wait)
- manual wakeup: 130 ms do the trick :(
- provoking a reset
    - fresh start (ACK is issued by uboot)
    - shepherd-launcher is stopped
    - @ 1100 s WD tries a nSTART
    - no one ACKs
    - @ 2100 s WD pulls reset low for 327 ms
    - BB resets properly

stop launcher::

    systemctl stop shepherd-launcher

TODO: Why is boot not working? Even a fresh BB does not respond to a ~ 20 ms LOW nSTART

- V2.0 SocketConfig: 3V, LED_OD, BTN_SENSE, GND (was taken from Kais schematic, but there the footprint was flipped)
- V2.1 SocketConfig: GND, BTN_SENSE, LED_OD, 3V3 (1:1 Shepherd 1.x)
- Button-Plug-Config for v2.0 - view from metalside: red, black, yellow, white (flipped from 1.x Version)
- Button-Config for 2.1: flipped back again
- problem: shepherd-service expects correct /etc/shepherd/config.yml ...
- all fine now - works!

Programming Target
------------------

- compile a demo 'https://github.com/geissdoerfer/shepherd-nrf52-demo'::

    sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
    sudo find / -iname arm-none-eabi-gcc

    export GNU_INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/bin/
    export SDK_ROOT=/home/hans/Downloads/NordicSDK/
    make all

- prepare target with default: 3V for target 1, with gpio-pass::

    sudo shepherd-sheep -vv target-power --voltage 2.8

- installed and configured modded version of openOCD (new playbook)
- fixed cli for 'target-power' and extended herd-tool accordingly

herd-steps::

    shepherd-herd target
    shepherd-herd start-openocd
    shepherd-herd target flash build.hex

    program /tmp/target_image.bin verify reset

Start by hand::

    # installed in /etc/systemd/system/
    sudo systemctl start shepherd-openocd.service

    # cfgs in /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/
    sudo /usr/bin/openocd -c "bindto 0.0.0.0" -f interface/beaglebone.cfg -f interface/shepherd.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/nrf52.cfg
    sudo /usr/bin/openocd -d -c "bindto 0.0.0.0" -f interface/beaglebone.cfg -f interface/shepherd.cfg -c "transport select swd" -f target/nrf52.cfg
    sudo /usr/bin/openocd -d -f interface/beaglebone.cfg -f interface/shepherd.cfg -c "transport select swd;telnet_port pipe;log_output /dev/null" -f target/nrf52.cfg

    # check if it runs:
    sudo netstat -apn | grep LISTEN

Success!! When Target is directly connected::

    shepherd-herd target flash build.hex

- flashed "powered" demo with 9600-baud serial and proper pin-config!

UART to Target
--------------

- Image sets baudrate to 9600
- pins had to be disabled in device-tree P9-24/26
- uEnv.txt had to load uart1

console::

    sudo stty -F /dev/ttyS1 9600
    sudo cat /dev/ttyS1

    # spits out text by manually triggering pins:
    1 triggered

      is outside of range of supported pins (7)


Bootpin-Overlay conflicts with bootup
-------------------------------------

- Problem 1: some essential PRU-Pins are also deciding how the BB boots up
- Problem 2: was hard to catch, because reboots und some powerups seem to be fine

- Used by Shepherd: P8 Pin 39-46, states in when unconnected with BB
    - 39, 40, are low
    - 41, 43 are High
    - 42, 44 are needed high (but shepherd feeds in 80 ms high, follows with serial, low afterwards)
    - 45, 46 are low
    - P8-42 is connected to P9-26 with 2 kOhm (is uart-rx ???)
    - P8-44 is connected to P9-18 with 2 kOhm (is i2c1-sda)
- Bootup from BB
    - 41, 42, 43, 44 are high
    - 45, 46 are low
- leaving one pin unconnected
    - 41 -> all Leds light up forever
    - 43 -> short break + flashes, repeat forever
    - 42, 44, 45, 46 -> no led response
- leaving some pins unconnected
    - 41+43 -> NoLeds
    - 42+44 -> NoLeds
    - 41 - 44 -> OK
    - 41+42 -> All Leds light up forever
    - 43+44 -> NoLeds
    - 42+43 -> Flashes
    - 42 - 44 -> NoLeds (????, pin 41 is high and expected to be high)
- Function during Boot
    - 41 - Bootdevice, High
    - 42 - CLKOUT, High
    - 43 - Bootdevice, High, but depends SDCard if LOW
    - 44 - Bootdevice, High

- solution: analog switch for 41-44

Something Else????
------------------

- 2nd (fresh) BBone was tested with current Shepherd v2.1 -> works fine (when omitting pins p9 41-44 during uboot)
