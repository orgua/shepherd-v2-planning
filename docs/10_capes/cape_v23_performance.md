# Shepherd Cape v2.3 - Performance

## Tested

- WD is fine now ⇾ Board gets turned on
- BB boots with Shepard Cape on
- BB-powered boot works, but turning Cape on crashes the 5V Rail (P9-7/8)
- WD restarting BB works

## Troubleshooting

### Profiling Ranges

- full range: 0 to 5V, 0 to 50 mA
- limited range: 1 to 3.9 V, 3uA to 40mA

### Harvester - low current measurement-limit

- draining below 1-2 uA ⇾ voltage seems to invert (SMU reports -0.3V), not caring about the set-voltage of the DAC
- adc-current values are equal to "zero"
- diode blocks (later tests show 2nA reverse current), because voltage at cathode (opAmp-Out) is similar high to DAC-Voltage
- something seems to reverse leak current ⇾ tldr: it is the OPA189 Negative Input Pin
    - **OPA189 input** can leak max +-1 nA (input bias current) and differential input impedance is 100 MOhm (100nA to 10V)
    - AD8421 inputs can leak max 2x +-500 pA, tests show < 1 nA
    - OPA2388 input can leak max +-400 pA (spec), tests show < 1 nA
    - diode is rated for 40 nA but shows in tests 2 nA @ 5V (see picture below)
    - capacitor C34 (Opa-Feedback) could leak ⇾ tests show < 1 nA @ +-5V-Range (see picture below)
    - and the op189 output ⇾ not relevant due to safe diode and capacitor
    - removing R20 stops the leak ⇾ hint at OPA189 or cap C34
    - removing C34 changes nothing ⇾ final clue for OPA189
- that may never occur with a real harvesting source (or work as a hard-to-detect offset)
- baking pcb off (80 °C, 30min) had no effect (mentioned in datasheet)
- this leakage is often not existent when SMU is freshly started for the day ⇾ firmware-update to 3.4.0 (2021-04, from 3.2.2 2016-04) did not help
    - see profile 25, whole voltage range, down to 0 uA
- changing R20 (Feedback-Lowpass) to 100R or 10k does not change behaviour
- tests with solar-cell (SM101K09L) shows that 2uA is near to dark environment
- old TODO:
    - reverse position of diode and shunt
    - OPA189 speaks of (8.3.3) input bias current clock feedthrough (switching input to correct intrinsic offset)
    - ⇾ it seems to be the "zero-drift" feature of OPA189 that gets triggered wrongly
    - worst outcome: 1-2 uA offset in measurement
- Update: this problem went away by using another py-lib for the SMU (and cleaner, more explicit init)

## Diode Comparison

- PMEG10010ELRX
    - rated for (extremely low leakage current) **4 nA @ 10 V & 25 °C** and 40 nA (typical, 150 nA max) at 100V & 25°C
    - measurement: -5 V result in **2.1 nA at room temperature**
    - seems the safest bet, because datasheet promises the spec
- SMMSD701T1G
    - rated for ~ 8-9 nA @ 6-12 V & 25 °C (curves in datasheet)
    - measurement: -5 V result in **1.4 nA at room temperature**
    - lowest leak-value but not distinguishable from PMEG-Version in Frontend
- RB168MM-40TR
    - rated for 50 (typical) to 550 uA reverse current @ 40 V
    - curves in datasheet show IR @ 5 V, 25°C at around 10 nA, up to 1000 nA at 75°C
    - measurement: -5 V result in **6.9 nA at room temperature**
- the first two diodes are fine!

### Reverse Current of Diodes

![RevDiode](media_v23/diode_reverse_currents_smu-measured.png)

## Harvester - Current Measurement

- 2R-Shunt, Gain x48 ⇾ 10R Shunt, Gain x10
    - no significant effect from profiler
    - **keep synced to emulator to save parts**
    - **keep 2R-Shunt**
- Lowpass between InAmp and ADC
    - 100k results in high offset of > offset of 11'800 n for 0 nA (ADC input seems to be raised by ADC itself)
    - 1k results in offset = ~ 182 n (Good) and lower Noise, mostly on full range (3-14x better)
    - 100R seems to worsen limited area (slightly), but improve full range (almost x2)
    - Cap was varied to match 80 - 160 kHz lowpass, but influence is minimal
    - 0R caused trouble with voltage dependend current reading +-10uA from 0 to 5V
    - **33R / 10nF** is fine, limited range gets minimal worse, but full range improves
- buffered shunt (parallel cap C35)
    - 470 nF instead of nothing: 10 - 20% improvement on limited and full range
    - nothing instead of 100 nF: 5-10 % worse on full range, minimal better on limited range (but with 100 nF seems the better bet)
    - 100nF instead of nothing: ~10% improvement on both ranges
    - **later tuning showed almost no influence of the cap (0, 10, 100nF) only max_error gets limited in profiler**
    - **10nF does suffice!**
- buffered inputs (Caps on V_HRV and V_Sense)
    - adding 2x 100nF is ~ 10 % worse
    - **remove**
- different diode (try alternatives)
    - no significant effect between new (and better) SMMSD701T1G-Diode and (current) PMEG10010ELRX
- slower OpAmp-Feedback
    - R20, 10k instead of 1k or 100R: 10-12% improvement for both ranges, but only static case (lowpass 16 kHz)
    - later tuning showed that 100R (compared to 330, 1k) are preferred, because OpAmp has to be fast (for the nonlinearitiy, ie. in voltage sweeps
    - **faste OpAMp** is better, as long as stable
- DAC to OpAmp Connection
    - slower response helps measurement
    - current 1k & 1nF are fine ⇾ 9 us risetime from rail to rail (same with 200R, 1nF)
    - 100R & 10nF seem to perform a bit better
- shield
    - is not hurting the measurement, but helps with noisy environments
- set DAC-Ref-voltage to external A5V
    - current-reading improvement, while voltage worsened? but error stayed after reversing the change
    - TODO: investigate

## Harvester - Voltage Measurement

- bigger shunt Resistor is 5-10% worse
- C35 parallel to shunt is better than no Cap, 100 nF is fine, 10nF also
- R16 before ADC-V is better smaller, but filtering is also
- Cap before ADC-V is better, 10nF compared to nothing brings 10 % improvement
- R18 before OpAmp was 1k, removal brings 10 % improvement
- Caps 100nF on Pinheader-Inputs is 5-10 % worsening
- R20 low ⇾ Voltage-Matcher should be rather fast (better for V_meas, worse for C_meas)
- DAC-Lowpass is fine, lower Freq helps measurement


Without ShuntBuffer the current reading may be noisy (1k OpAmp Feedback, 0nF Shunt-Buffer)

![ShuntBuff0](media_v23/hrv_iv110Hz_Shuntbuff_C35_0nF_FB_R20_1k.png)

Improvement with 10nF ShuntBuffer

![ShuntBuff10](media_v23/hrv_iv110Hz_Shuntbuff_C35_10nF_FB_R20_1k.png)

OpAmp is stable enough to lower FB to 100R ⇾ this gets rid of the nonlinearity in the sweep (area where open circuit voltage meets voltage ramp):

![ShuntFB100R](media_v23/hrv_iv110Hz_Shuntbuff_C35_10nF_FB_R20_100R.png)


## Emulator

- can't produce 5 V with 50 mA
- even at 0 mA the limit of 5 V is not completely on point,
- at 50 mA around 4 V are usable without large error
- ⇾ seems to be fine for modern electronics
- 2 R Shunt resistor is responsible for 100 mV drop (50 mA)
- R10 from 100k changed to 0R ⇾ offset still around 15.x, similar as with 33R in harvester
- 5V-Voltage regulator needs at least +1V Input ⇾ raise 6v_Rail from 5.4V to 6.17V ⇾ Emulator improves to 50mA @ ~4.28V
- Opa388 seems to be worse than the Opa189 ⇾ switch to this one

![Emu1](media_v23/profile_quiver_offset_sheep0_cape_v230c1_profile_07_short_C6_increased_1uF_emu_a.png)

## BB-Powered Mode

- turning cape on when on BB-USB-Power crashes the system
- 5V_BB (P9-7/8) gets connected to 5V Line with inductor and large 1mF Cap
- most inductors show only minimal influence ⇾ remove them
- more capacity on power-line is better (A5V is most significant), see traces below

No additional Buffering on A5V-Line

![Emu2](media_v23/hrv_iv110Hz_A5V_0mF.png)

1mF Cap on A5V line - less noise!

## Stabilize ADC-Readings

Plan: work through datasheet for more design guideline hints

- ADC ADS8691
    - use X7R caps for V_in and ref-pins
    - low impedance sense-input
- InAmp AD8421
    - VS with 100nF + 10uF
    - RG with minimized capacitance
    - connection to ADC: 100R + 3nF
    - ref-voltage with OP1177, with 5k feedback, no C, 10 uF buffer for OpAmp Input
    - low impedance connections, input can be buffered
- OpAmp Opa189
    - same as Opa388
    - seems more stable than opa388, fb-cap can be omitted
- OpAmp Opa388
    - shield / isolate from air-currents and heat-sources
    - place 100nF directly to pwr-in and use groundplane
- DAC8562
    - AVdd with 100pF, 1nF, 100nF, 1uF
    - VRef-Buffer, higher capacitance raises noise floor?
    - internal reference is more noisy (1.4 to 3x less noise with perfect external ref) ⇾ fail because voltage has huge error (current got more stable though)
- LDO LP2989
    - bypass cap 10nF C0G or NP0
    - provide VIn >= VOut + 1V
- Inverter LT3487
    - Thermal Pad (GND) low impedance, many vias
    - bypass with X7R
    - negative channel >= 10uF, pos Channel > 4.7 uF
    - phase lead caps for dampened load response (10-33pF parallel to FB-Res)
    - input can start at 1uF

## Noise-Reducing Experiments

- ADC: R10 33R, C62 10nF lowpass, 482kHz ⇾ not much difference?
- R8, 5k OpAmp FB from 2k
    - 50 mV from std-dev 2800-4000-26, to 25-52-25
    - 2V from 31-60-31 to 25-56-30
- C3, 1nF OpAmp FB remove
    - 50mV completely unstable
- C5, remove 1uF DAC_Ref-Buffer
- DAC_Ref to A5V ⇾ 1.4 to 3x less noise expected
    - 2V to std 22-55-29
    - current-channel is improving a bit overall (>5%), but with 20% larger max-errors
    - voltage-channel is 25-100% worse (mean)
- HRV
    - R20 back to 1k
    - R22 to 33 R, C140 to 10nF
    - R27 to 33 R, C36 to 10nF
    - R27 back to 100 ⇾ 100R & 10 nF ⇾ 160 kHz
    - R27 1k, C36 1nF ⇾ same 160 kHz
    - C35 Buff, 0nF,  10nF, 100nF
    - R20 FB smaller 1k, 330R, 100R, 33R
        - 100R - 50 us for 0 to 5V, significantly smaller bump between ramp and open voltage
        - openC still 50us, even with reduced R27/200R ⇾ Scope shows 9us risetime at diode (200R)
        - 1k (R27, back to normal) still 9us risetime on scope
- cross-supply DAC
- emu
    - DAC-out 33R, 10nF
