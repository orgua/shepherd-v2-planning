# Cape v2.5 - PCB Changes

Status 2024-02: still not produced - maybe skipped for switching platform

## Implemented Changes v2.5a

- lower current-limiting resistors from 470 R to 240 R (see new target)
- emu U32 replace OPA189 by OPA388
- LP for InAmp AD8421 ⇾ 80kHz with 2x 100R, +2x 1nF to GND
- change invNr-Sys to solid white rect
- Emu - use 10mV Ref directly, without Switch
- Rec - use GND as Ref directly
- stabilize 10 mV ⇾ 1uF increase to 2x 10uF, 2R increase to 10R
- replace electrolytic Caps by MLCC (Optionals on Backside)

⇾ implemented in V2.5a - https://github.com/orgua/shepherd_v2_planning/tree/main/PCBs/shepherd_cape_v2.5a

## Implemented Changes v2.5b/c

- production optimized for JLC
  - 6 layer includes via filling & capping (type 7) -> optional as via in pad is not used
  - vias were reduced to 0.2 mm hole, 0.35 ring dia
- replace target header with 40pin edge-Connector
- add 17V converter (previously external)
- Screw-Connector now supports 7 - 17V
- remove XYZ - for this last version - testbed only
  - usb-input
  - harvester frontend
  - ~~external switch & LED~~
- pin-changes on BBB Sockets, documented in `shepherd-git/hardware/_deprecated/beaglebone_pinout_concept.xlsx`
  - P8_14 is GPIO7, was targets GPIO0
  - P8_17 is GPIO8, was targets GPIO1
  - P8_27 is pru1_GPIO8, was pru_uart_tx
  - P8_28 is pru1_GPIO10, in addition to PRU1-LED0 (switch to input)
  - P8_29 is pru1_GPIO9, was pru1_batOK (switch to input)
  - P8_30 is pru1_GPIO11, in addition to PRU1-LED1 (switch to input)
  - P8_37 is now controlling direction of gpio-group A
  - P8_38 is now controlling direction of gpio-group B
  - P8_40 is pru1_GPIO7, was pru_uart_rx
  - P9_14 is now controlling direction of gpio-group C, was EN_Recorder
  - P9_25 is free, was CS_ADC2_REC
  - P9_27 is PWR_GOOD_L, was CS_DAC_REC
  - P9_41B is PWR_GOOD_H, was CS_ADC1_REC
- Target mapping Changed!
  - Target-GPIO9..11 are now input pru0-r31 (P8_29, P8_28, P8_30)
  - Target_GPIO0 is now UART-RX
  - BBone Pins changed
  - PinDirections are different
  - new BBone to target mapping is in separate section below, it now supports recording 12 pins
- GPS-Sync-Header added

## Implemented Changes v2.5d

- BOM-Trouble
  - NLAS4684 / NLAS4684FCT1G not available at all
    - Analog Switch, Dual SPDT, 500 mOhm Rds, 300 mA continuous, 500 mA peak, <10 nA Leakage (1 nA for -55 to 25°C)
    - we still have **~200x NLAS4684MN**, so will switch to that for now (+ larger, safer package)
  - PI5A4158 / PI5A4158ZAEX currently not avail
    - Analog Switch, Dual SPDT, 800 mOhm Rds, ~40 nA Leakage, high speed ~150 MHz with < 40 pF
    - PI3USB102G: 4 Ohm, 5V5 max, 6 pF, **BUT** 200 nA leakage
    - PI5A23157: 10 Ohm, 6V max, 18 pF, **BUT** 50 - 1000 nA leakage
    - **PI5A4157 / 729-PI5A4157CEX: single channel version of same IC, but only larger SC70 package (2.2x2.4) available**
    - **729-PI5A4157ZUEX**: UDFN-Package, 1x1 mm, mouser totally hides out of life parts, is in stock
  - LP2989-3.3 not avail as VSSOP-8 / TSOP
    - switch to WSON?
    - **926-LP2989AIMM33NOPB**, same but double the price
  - 10k 0402 667-ERJ-2GEJ103X -> 603-RC0402FR-7W10KL
  - 5.1k 0402 667-ERJ-2RKF5101X -> 603-RC0402FR-075K1L

BOM-Additions:
- 60x 649-77313-802-46LF, header 2x23
- 10x 667-ERA-3ARW102V, 1k-0603-0.05%
- 10x 754-RG1608N-101-W-T1, 100R-0603-0.05%

Manual Mods (not final):

- xp: add 150R as LP for Emu-InAmp (~50kHz)
- xp: double C141, C3 (Emu around U32 Opa)
- xp: 10mV Ref input - C149 - 1uF + 10uF

TODO:
- software changes
- harvester seems a bit too fast - current is overswinging - see SM141K04LV ivcurve
- disable GPIO IO if voltage is cut (due to low_threshold)
- switch to usb PD with 12V?

## Errors of v2.5d

- button-connector has no paste on gnd-pads
