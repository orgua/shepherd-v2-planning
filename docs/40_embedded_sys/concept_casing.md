# Hardware Casing for Nodes (2020)

**Deprecated / shelved!** Current lasercut case is in [main repo](https://github.com/orgua/shepherd/tree/dev/hardware/case_lasercut)

## Constraints

- nodes can vanish, wander
    - fixate
    - keep inconspicuous (under desk an option?), make it look official / blend in
- nodes can spook new people in the same office
    - must look professional, official
    - be transparent about the function (inform current people in office, but also use sticker to provide a FAQ-Website
- must support cooling (direct sunlight, proximity to radiator)
    - convectional cooling would be the easiest
- must contain
    - BBone with shepherd Cape (75 x 55 x 25 mm)
    - POE-Converter (81 x 55 x 25 mm)
    - Target nodes (20 x 30 x 4 mm) - orthogonal on capelet or in direction of longest edge of capelet)
    - < 20 cm Network cable
    - power-connection
    - USB-Stick (45 x 20 x 9 mm)
    - opening for one RJ-45-Socket
- must be transparent to RF
- input Marco:
    - open and transparent is fine and wanted (!)
    - boxy is ok
    - preferable hard mounted to the wall with just one cable attached

## Layout

- flat on one level
    - X: 75 + 45 + 30
    - Y: 55 + 55
    - Z: 25
    - 150 x 110 x 25 (412 cm²)
    - pro: clean,
    - contra: harder to cool, less optimal RF-performance (antenna near to ground)
- Stacked
    - X: 75 + 45
    - Y: 55
    - Z: 25 + 25 + 30
    - 120 x 55 x 80 (528 cm²)
    - pro: more boxy, would better fit on top of the cable canal
    - contra:

## Solutions

- 3d-Printing
    - flexible and custom case
    - way to expensive for 30 Nodes
- Casing in laser-acrylic or plywood
    - solid, custom
    - may look also unprofessional, like a building kit
    - design without screws ⇾ <https://hackaday.com/2013/02/27/acrylic-enclosures-use-integrated-clips-to-do-away-with-fasteners/>
- off-the-shelf case with custom front
    - can look professional
    - you have to take what the market offers
    - way around custom front is: just include an opening for the cable with a gasket (or right there where two halves meet)
