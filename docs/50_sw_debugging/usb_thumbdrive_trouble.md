# USB Flash-Drive storage troubles

## TLDR

Thumb-drive was the culprit - it got not even warm, but refused to take additional data after first ~ 200 mb. Even Syncs inbetween confirmed that writing was done up to this point...

## Problem

Saving measurement-data to usb thumb-drives seems to trigger a chain-reaction with high cpu-load and missed sample-buffers.

System:

- BBone Black
- Philips 256 GB USB 3.0 Thumb-drives

expected suspects:

- py-code
- faulty kernel-driver for usb
- bad thumb-drive



## Bug in more Detail

Used code:

```Shell
sudo shepherd-sheep -vv run --config /etc/shepherd/example_config_harvest.yml
sudo shepherd-sheep -vv run --config /etc/shepherd/example_config_emulation.yml
# used 600 s db_traces.h5 as input, 521 mb, 870 kb/s
```

- flash drive contains source and destination, 180 s worked, 600 s failed after 293 s (run out of buffers), 224 mb
- failing because of full msg-fifo, with cpu-usage of ~ 86 %, no significant ram or nw usage
- despite mount-option "commit=2" the data is written every ~ 20 to 30 s with peek rates of 12-21 mb/s
    - h5py-trouble? ⇾ changed h5.driver to stdio and _nslots from 521 to 100, without success
    - smaller write cache ⇾ worse performance (~ 230 s), but sysutil shows
        - source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/292024/how-to-reduce-linux-write-buffer-for-removable-devices
        - sudo echo 5000000 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes      ⇾ 5 mb instead of 200 ? or 20% ram-ratio ⇾ 93 mb
        - echo 300 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs    ⇾ 3 s instead of 30
    - bigger write cache ⇾ no difference (~ 280 s)
        - echo 300000000 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes
        - echo 6000 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs
- just heat-throttling? 150 mA * 5V = 0.75 W in a plastic case ⇾ opened and cooled a stick
- usb-errors? the flash drive seems to be the troublemaker ⇾ even on other systems it shows a wavy write-trend
- lower cpu-usage does not work (mean ~ 80 %, instead of ~86% with monitors)
- **reading from mmc, writing to flash drive ⇾ failed also**


## Linux-Optimizations for file-writes

Adding Flash drive

- power-increase from 322 mA to 387 mA (passive), ~590 mA (active)
- detected as philips USB Flash Drive, high speed, usb mass storage,
- 512-byte logical blocks, 231 GiB, Mode Sense 45 00 00 00, write cache disabled, read cache enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
- DPO: Disable Page out -
- FUA: Force unit access - FUA write command will not return until data is written to media, thus data written by a completed FUA write command is on permanent media
- run playbook "setup-ext-storage" with mod for sda1 ⇾ fails because of "p1"-addition
