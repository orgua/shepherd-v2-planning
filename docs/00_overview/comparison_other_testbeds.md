# Comparison to other Testbeds

**Short**: none of these offer emulation of energy environments

## D-Cube

- D-Cube-Overview_
- DBs: relational ⇾ MariaDB, Time Series ⇾ InfluxDB
- user interface ⇾ Grafana
- gpio-tracing ⇾ isolators for usb, power, bi-dir gpio (TI ISO7220M, ISO7221M, ADUM3160, NXE2)
- latency profiling ⇾ Navspark-GL, later uBlox Neo
- power profiling ⇾ TI LMP92064
- interference generator ⇾ JamLab-NG
- supports binary patching
- PoE via PEM1305
