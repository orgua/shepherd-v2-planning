# Boot Pin Interference

**TLDR**: cut connection to these pins per default.

## Problem

- shepherd-pcb stops beaglebone from booting
- startup behavior is determined by 16 pins, which are on P8 Pin 31 to 46
- only the first 6 and last 2 are important
- last two are not used by shepherd

## BOOT-Pins (from BB-Green-Schematic)

- to boot from internal MMC1 the bits from BOOT[4:0] must be 0b11100
- the high pins are held high for the first ~7 sec
- schematic shows that pins are Pulled up or down with 100k

## Changes through Shepherd PCB

- Boot-pins have 1k input Resistance and are then pulled up to 3V3 with 100k
- even with floating 3v3 the board won't boot
- each boot pin is also connected to another Beaglebone-Pin

## Test & Improve

- 1k input resistance is fine
- shepherd PCB alone shows
    - (fresh PCB) pin 41-46 has 110k to GND, 101k to 3v3  ⇾ maybe still a short
    - (test PCB) pin 41-46 has open connection to GND, 101k to 3v3
- with BB connected
    - pin 41-44 show 44k to GND, 42k to 3v3
    - pin 45/46 show 106k to GND, 100k to 3v3
- previous 1.x hw-revision shows diodes to these pins, but this seems sub-optimal. makes pins to input-only, but only fast-switching for rising-edges
- shepherd-enable (p8-13) stays low during boot ⇾ perfect to disconnect board from power
- behavior of secondary pins (see table above)
    - BOOT[0:3] stay low
    - BOOT[4] stays high
    - BOOT[5:7] high during boot (7.7) on sys with shepherd installed, stays high on fresh sys
- disabling uart1 and i2c1 brings:
    - BOOT[0:3] stay low
    - BOOT[4:5] stays high
    - BOOT[6:7] high during boot (7.7), then low
- add uart1-pins to shepherd dts (and set p9-17 to also input pin)
    - BOOT[0:3] stay low
    - BOOT[4:7] high during boot (7.7), then low
- booting with shepherd works with
    - P8-44/45 disconnected, OR
    - P8-15/16 disconnected, OR
    - switching P8-15/16 (LOW) with P9-17/18 (HIGH) works!


## Changes to System

- i2c1 is only for target-pin-header and can be disabled by default (needed for target-programmer later)
- uart1 is disabled for now (to access pins in linux)
- switch Boot[2:3] with other PRU-Pins that are high during boot
    - OR disconnect pins when disabled
    - switch P8-15/16 (LOW) with P9-17/18 (HIGH)
- increase resistance of pru-pins, 10k should be fine, when only input
- bat_ok can be at the end (of PRU-Pins), because it is write-only
