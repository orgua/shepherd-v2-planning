- Images
    - Best Image: am57xx eMMC flasher ubuntu console, 2 GB, https://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu#eMMC:_BeagleBoard-X15_and_BeagleBone_AI
    - Better Image: am57xx eMMC flasher debian iot, 4 GB, https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Debian_Buster_IOT_Snapshot
            - untested alternative: debian console, sub 1 GB
    - Wrong Image: am57xx debian IoT am5729, 8 GB unpacked, http://beagleboard.org/latest-images
- Install
    - "boot" button is gone, but image flashes automatically (LED Larson-Scanner, until finished with copy, then static)
- ubuntu 18.04.4-console-armhf-2020-03-12
    - **Warning**: CPU gets very hot, even whole PCB, 66 °C idle, 77 °C after apt upgrade
    - takes about 1.2 GB of the 15 GB eMMC
    - dmesg reports 24.59 BogoMIPS (BBG shows 995?!?)
    - uname: 4.19.94-ti-r36
    - dd if=/dev/zero of=./testfile bs=100M count=1 oflag=direct -> 73 MB/s (x3.5 of BBG)
    - GBE works with Cat 5e, 5m

    - 2nd AI shows "sudo hexdump -C /dev/mmcblk1boot1" -> .U3.BBONE-AI00A1 | 1933EMAI000015 -> board 15
- ansible: bootstrap, install, setup_linux_configuration, _performance, _security
    - uname: 4.19.94-ti-r51
    - uname: 5.4.24-armv7-x20 -> not booting
- **oddities**
    - some restarts are not coming back & there are random shutdowns
    - cpu stays boiling hot, even with 99.6% idling, governor set to powersave
        - ubuntu 18.4.4 from elinux, with 4.19.94-r36 & r51
        - debian 10.4 iot from elinux, with 4.19.94-r41?
        - debian 10.4 console -> does not even flash
        - debian 10.3 iot from bb.org with 4.19.94-r42
        - debian 9.12 console from elinux with 4.14.108-r134 stays at 50 deg, only one?!?
    - ram only shows 578 MB ?!? it should be 1 Gig
        - DSP reserves 300 MB+
        - get ram back: https://groups.google.com/g/beagleboard/c/-kDcIPsLCkc/m/xHyrFKepAgAJ
    - there is no device-tree overlay yet, just a big monolithic dts
    - forum-post: it is easy to kill a cpu with wrong pin-inputs, https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/beagleboard&showsearch=true&showpopout=true&showtabs=false&hideforumtitle=true&parenturl=http%3A%2F%2Fbeagleboard.org%2Fdiscuss#!category-topic/beagleboard/beaglebone-ai/fzwYWLDrQJw
        - some pins are connected to two balls on the CPU, but io-use must be mutual exclusive
    - PRU-Changes -> ll /sys/class/remoteproc/ -> remoteproc4 to remoteproc7
    - addresses in RAM changed most likely as well

documentation

- nice pin-overview https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fE-AsDZvJ-bBwzNBj1_sPDrutvEvsmARqFwvbw_HkrE/edit#gid=1518010293
- nice to distinguish BB-Models: cat /proc/device-tree/model -> BeagleBoard.org BeagleBone AI
- device tree is raw, see https://www.elinux.org/EBC_Exercise_41_Pin_Muxing_for_the_AI

TODO
----
- save power
- turn off not needed processors,
- unload (lsmod) wifi, bt, media (videodev, v4l2), videobuf, vpdma, ti_csc
- apt: bb-node-red-installer
